Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, TASK sign MoU
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Asia (ERAU), and Telangana Academy for Skills and Knowledge (TASK) on Friday entered into a memorandum of understanding for skill development in the aerospace domain.
A release on the MoU signing at the Singapore Air Show said the institutions have agreed to collaborate on providing curriculum and instructional design for creating and assessing training and educational programmes, faculty development and career counselling.
TASK chief executive office Sujiv Nair said one of the key focus areas of the MoU is to enhance professional skills for youth, ranging from semi-skilled to highly skilled segments like technicians, instructors, engineers and scientists over the next few years.
ERAU head Graham Hunt said: There is increasing recognition within the industry that the skills which were believed to be pre-requisite to aviation employment have changed and may not be sufficient to produce expert operators in the aviation/aerospace industry.
ERAU specialises in aviation and aerospace with more than 150 locations in the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Middle East. It also offers online programmes.

Decision against uploading GOs on website flayed
The Telangana Telugu Desam Party (TTDP) has criticised the State government for deciding against uploading the Government Orders in its official website.
TDP polit bureau member Ravula Chandrasekhar Reddy alleged that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has directed the officials concerned against uploading the GOs in the public domain. At a time when the Right to Information Act was being implemented across the country enabling citizens to access the information about works launched by the government, the TRS government, in a non-transparent manner, was trying to conceal the information against the spirit of the Act passed by the Parliament.
Doubts are being raised over the TRS governments move to set aside the provisions of the RTI. The government owes an explanation to the people on withholding the information, he said. The TDP would take up the issue with the Central government, if need be, to ensure that the information pertaining to governments activities was kept in the public domain. Criticising the TRS leaders for putting up hoardings and flexi posters at all vantage points across the city, he lamented that people were forced to know about the governments activities through them. He expressed concern that the Chief Minister and his Cabinet colleagues were not coming to the Secretariat, the seat of State administration. The State administration appears to operate through remote control, he said.
Mr. Chandrasekhar Reddy alleged that the government did not spend Rs. 791 crore sanctioned by the Centre for taking up drought-relief works. The powers that be were keen on ensuring the ruling partys victory in the elections rather than taking up issues of immediate public importance.

Hopes go through the roof
Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Raos Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation election promise of constructing one lakh 2-bedroom houses has resulted in a rush of hopefuls thronging offices, unaware even if their applications can be considered.
Ranga Reddy Collectorate is one of the government offices being flooded with applicants. For about a week now, around 10,000 applicants a day have placed their handwritten request.
Sans a government order or guidelines to process applications, queries regarding the status of application and timeframe for processing are met with inadequate responses.
We have been asked to collect applications though a decision about their processing is awaited from the government. At this time, applicants cannot be told about the status of applications, an RR district official said.
Incidentally, a similar situation prevailed last year before the government issued guidelines to fulfil an identical poll promise made before the 2014 general election.
Subsequently, it was decided that every Assembly constituency in the State would get 400 houses. Until the guidelines were received, officials were forced to collect applications during public grievances programmes at the collectorates without being able to address other issues.
Until about a week ago, applicants continued pouring in at Hyderabad collectorate. They are being asked to apply later. A large number of applications has been already received so far, a source in Hyderabad collectorate said. In Hyderabad district alone, around 2 lakh applicants who applied and paid during past public housing schemes, are waiting for a home.
Absence of instructions not withstanding, the district officials have set out to identify land for constructing the houses. Land available in slums and empty government land are being considered.
The TRSs thumping victory in GHMC polls has also put Secunderabad Cantonment public representatives in the hot seat.
A ward member admitted feeling the stress of increased demand for two-bedroom houses from slums in the cantonment but the Cantonment Board, a central government municipal body, is not a partner in the scheme.

TS urges Centre to protect rights of States in GST regime
Finance Minister Etala Rajender has requested the Centre not to usurp the rights of the States in the name of implementation of General Sales Tax (GST) regime. He asked the Union Government not to cut the funding for welfare schemes in the coming budget.
Speaking at a meeting of the Empowered Committee of States Finance Ministers on GST at New Delhi on Friday, he raised several priority issues of the State, including its request for increase in the borrowing limit to 3.5 per cent of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) from the existing 3 per cent under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act and release of Central Sales Tax (CST) dues.
Further, Mr. Rajender urged the Centre to keep liquor, petroleum products and agricultural products out of the proposed GST regime as their inclusion would deflate the States finances badly. In response to his requests, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that a decision on Telanganas request for borrowing limit hike would be taken at the next Cabinet meeting and the CST dues would also be cleared by making allocation in the coming budget. Mr. Rajender, speaking to newspersons after the meeting, said that Mr. Jaitley had also assured on compensating the losses to be incurred by States on account of GST implementation.

Two minor fires, abandoned suitcase create flutter
Three incidents  two minor fires and an abandoned suitcase in the important L block of the AP Secretariat  created a furore here on Friday.
The first incident occurred when fire broke out in the forenoon due to a short-circuit in the second floor of the L block but it was quickly put out by the fire wing staff. Later, an abandoned suitcase in the sixth floor corridor caught the attention of the security personnel and the area was cordoned off on suspicion that it might contain some explosive material. After the SPF and security personnel checked the suitcase, the contents turned out to be some clothes and footwear of a woman employee who apparently left it outside while entering one of the rooms. Before the security and fire safety personnel could heave a sigh of relief, a small fire broke out in the rear end of the L block near Samtrupti on the ground floor. Some waste papers which flew and fell on a lamp lit to offer puja near a portrait of a deity created the commotion.

AgriGold case: HC ticks off CID
A Division Bench of the High Court, comprising acting Chief Justice D.B. Bhosale and Justice S.V. Bhatt, on Friday expressed doubts over the manner in which the CID of Andhra Pradesh was investigating the criminal case pertaining to the AgriGold Consortium.
The manner in which the case was handled helped the accused siphon off funds, the Bench said in an indictment of the CID officers.
The Bench was dealing with a writ petition filed seeking CBI inquiry into the misdeeds of the AgriGold Consortium.
It was alleged that innocent depositors, mostly fromKarnataka, AP, and Telangana, had been duped to the tune of thousands of crores of rupees. The AP police were dragging their feet in the case, it was alleged. The Bench expressed shock when it was told that only Rs. 6 lakh was available in the accounts of the defaulting companies. Had the police been alert, the money could not have disappeared, it observed, and directed the CID to trace the money.
The Bench also asked the AgriGold Consortium to deposit Rs.25 lakh towards functioning of the three-member committee headed by retired Judge of the High Court to oversee the sale of prime properties and distribution of the proceeds among the depositors.
Justice G.V. Seethapathi, former Judge of the High Court, who was also Registrar of the court for a considerable time, is now heading the committee.

HMR breaks the ground at Sultan Bazaar
early two months after the Hyderabad Metro Rail authorities won over the businessmen of Sultan Bazaar to allow the elevated carriageway to be built through it as part of Corridor Two  Jubilee Bus Station to Falaknuma, marking and soil testing has begun on the stretch.
In the last couple of days, metro rail engineers have installed soil boring machinery in three sites and are working at nights when the markets usual hustle-bustle is absent. Altogether, the bazaar will have 10 piers or pillars to support the viaduct superstructure atop. Soil testing will be done at all 10 sites before pier work starts.
Senior metro rail officials state that marking of properties lying on the less than half-a-km stretch has also commenced as per the agreement reached between the owners, tenant shopkeepers and hawkers trading between the Bata showroom up to Andhra Bank on the other end.
Sultan Bazaar road is about 40 ft wide and this will be widened to 65 ft rather than the original plan of 100 ft as per the compromise formula worked out. Roughly 10 ft front space of 120-odd properties is likely to be taken over when the road widening begins after the soil testing and only after taking the consent of the stakeholders.
We are happy the contentious issue got resolved amicably. We are now requesting the metro rail officials to complete the work quickly so that we can get back to do our businesses normally and traffic issues too can be sorted out, avers V. Kishen Yadav, president, Sultan Bazaar Traders Joint Action Committee for alignment change of Corridor Two.
Mr. Yadav is particularly pleased that the hawkers interests have been taken care of. Hawkers were at the mercy of the shopkeepers and had to do their businesses out in the open. Now, they can do under the viaduct getting protection from sun and rain.
Hawkers Association vice-president A.G. Khandilkar says We got written assurances from the metro rail authorities about rehabilitating us. We are waiting for the construction to be done fast.
HMR Managing Director N.V.S. Reddy explained that the plan is to complete construction of 10 piers within a month, but if we hit a rock, it could take up to three months. Visibly relieved about the work processing sans any protest, he reiterates that any property losing 50 per cent space will be provided alternate accommodation in the Sultan Bazaar Metro complex at Putlibowli.

Minister asks IT firms to set up shop in tier-II cities
The Telangana government was very keen on developing Karimnagar and Khammam along with Warangal as tier-II IT bubs towards transforming the State into a knowledge society, said IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao on Friday.
The objective was to make available the benefits of information technology to all citizens, especially those in rural areas to generate employment and also over to boost socio-economic development, he said.
Mr. Rao was speaking at the inauguration of IT incubation tower and laying of foundation stone of CYIENT at the 45-acre IT SEZ at Madikonda in Warangal. Special incentives were being offered to IT industry to expand their business operations and move to tier-II locations.
Cost advantage, abundant availability of physical, social infrastructure and skilled human resource were some of the positive features of these towns for the industry when compared to other locations in the country, he said.
The Incubation Centre funded by the TS government and constructed by TS Industrial Infrastructure Corporation on two acres has total built up area of 15,000 sq ft to enable start-ups and small IT firms to operate in a plug and play hassle-free environment. It is expected to provide direct and indirect employment to 1,000 qualified youth. IT major Cyient will soon be establishing a state-of-the-art software development centre in Madikonda, on a five acre campus, said founder and chairman B.V.R. Mohan Reddy.
Employing about 1,000 professionals over the next 18-24 months, it would support Cyients worldwide digital technology initiatives, including those in IoT, big data analytics, and smart cities, he said.

Transparency in hiking school fee sought
The Hyderabad Schools Parents Association said the Telangana government should also follow the Tamil Nadu Fee Regulation Act that prohibits schools from increasing fee exorbitantly and every hike has to be done transparently with the involvement of parents. Tamil Nadu has the lowest fee structure in schools, HSPA representatives said.
They also demanded the government to make public the Financial Audit of 12 schools ordered by the government last year along with the Action Taken Report. Since the schools are increasing fee without any reason the government should pass orders preventing any fee hikes for the next academic year till a proper mechanism for Independent fee regulation is brought in force.
With the governments monitoring system almost nil, schools are diverting funds to groups managed by them and showing them as rent for land and buildings to mislead people and the government. Fearing scrutiny by parents most schools are not even displaying fee structure though the norms mandate that they display it in at least three places prominently in the school, the parents alleged.
Schools are also giving individually printed customised fee challans to each student in order not to disclose the overall fee structure.
The HSPA has already filed a Public Interest Litigation for the implementation of GO MS 91 and will not hesitate to file more cases against the government, if it fails to act on its demands.

WhatsApp came in handy during Hudhud relief work
Social media has, no doubt, cast a lasting impression on daily life these days.
But, it would be surprising to see a group of engineers using it as an effective tool for taking up restoration works after a major natural calamity.
WhatsApp has come in handy for a group of engineers who created a group post Hudhud, a category 4 cyclone, which devastated Visakhapatnam and other north coastal districts in October 2014. They created a closed group which became functional three days after the calamity struck and acted as main tool of communication for information sharing between the officials concerned, including the District Collector.
According to a post on the World Bank website, in the event of breach of road, the engineers shared information through WhatsApp with a clear location and a short explanation of the problem. The person responsible for the area responded with a message stating how long it would take to clear the block. The group members even posted requests for tools and JCBs which helped in identifying and accessing the required resources. This was followed by correspondence related to the action once the problem was redressed along with a photograph of the restored site.
No meetings or discussions at the district headquarter level had to be organised. The District Collector joined the group and gave instruction to the department through the closed WhatsApp group, the post recalled.
As a result, most of the roads were functional within three to four days and the whole department worked to provide its services through messaging system without any meetings and formal orders.
Social media and pre-designed apps are effective when written reports and formal meetings are not required, the post said.

Mandali panel recommends action against Roja, Nani
: A fact-finding committee headed by Deputy Speaker Mandali Buddha Prasad recommended action against two YSRC MLAs -- R.K. Roja and Kodali Nani -- as their behaviour in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly had the potential to bring disrepute to the legislature. The committee was set up to go into the behaviour of the legislators in the Assembly on December 22 last, the day when the House witnessed acrimonious debate between the ruling TDP and the main Opposition YSRC members. The proceedings of the day culminated in the House passing a resolution suspending Ms. Roja from the service of the House for one year for using abusive language against Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu. The committee, which concluded its deliberations on Friday, had reportedly recommended that appropriate action be initiated against Ms. Roja and Kodali Srivenkateswara Rao.

Higher education should be given more importance
Former civil servant and Additional Chief Secretary of Tamil Nadu, R. Christodas Gandhi, emphasised on higher education and wealth generation as two demands that must get translated into government schemes for improving the lives of the marginalised.
Against the popular perception, welfare schemes work only to keep the marginalised where they are, instead of bettering their living conditions, he said, speaking at the pre-budget consultation on Andhra Pradesh Budget for the year 2016-17, organised by Peoples Monitoring Committee on Friday.
Drawing a parallel between investments on poor peoples housing and that on higher education, Mr. Gandhi said the former as a welfare scheme would not improve the capability of the beneficiary to build his own house, which the latter does.
We should be asking for things that will build our capabilities. We can sacrifice anything for higher education. Welfare schemes, on the other hand, do not improve our living conditions at all, Mr. Gandhi said.
Elaborating on what to demand from budget, he said development is not included in welfare schemes, and development schemes do not include SCs and STs.
While a fourth of the budget is spent on welfare, the allocations for infrastructure and industries exceed 50 per cent.
Borrowings are spent on development schemes, of which SCs and STs do not reap any benefit, yet they end up sharing the burden of the debt repayment.
Former Director of Indian Institute of Economics U. Subramanyam said the budget does not suffer from paucity of funds, but allocations need closer scrutiny. Though the allocations were high under SCP, only 50 per cent of it was spent in 2014-15, and it could be similar for the current financial year too.

IT company shuts shop
Months after being a part of the prestigious global event, Cricket All-Stars featuring the whos who of the cricketing world, an MNC has allegedly sacked most of its Hyderabad employees.
The company  Azur Global  was the official IT partner for the event in which three matches were played under the captaincy of Sachin Tendulkar and Shane Warne in the United States in November.
The company, which has an office in Madhapur, has informed about 35 of its employees on Friday that they will be shutting shop.
The company, which provides a range of IT services, has offices in Chennai, the U.S. and Canada.
The employees protested the decision of the management and demanded that they be compensated in a proper manner.
We have not been getting salaries for close to three months now, but even then we continued working, said Varaprasad, team leader.
Many of us left jobs in good companies and joined here because we thought it is a big brand. All this while, we were never told about the financial health of the company or the extreme step that will be taken by the management. When we turned up for work, we were orally told that we can look for other jobs and the pending salaries will be paid in June.
According to the aggrieved employees, no one from the management side was able to negotiate or address their concerns.
I have seen such situations in the past where companies closed, but they followed some procedure. The employees are usually given a cheque of their outstanding salary or asked to complete official formalities. Surprisingly, we were just asked to leave the floor. When we protested, we were threatened saying that we will be forcefully evacuated, said Vamshi, manager, recruitments.
In spite of repeated attempts, representatives of the company management could not be reached.

Ode to a rebel star
Its been 44 years since a young man from Osmania University was murdered on the steps of Hostel 1, obviously for his political leanings. As a new biography revisits the life of George Reddy, nothing appears to have changed in these four decades, as Indian universities are in turmoil over the very same issues and ideas.
What made George Reddy, the legendary stormy petrel and a brilliant student described by his admirers as Che Guevara of Osmania University, take on a society that was so insensitive and indifferent ?
Apart from the happenings around the world in the late 1960s  from student revolt in Paris, liberation struggle in Vietnam, US military incursions in Central America, the Palestine-Israel face-off, killing of Che Guevara to the Naxalbari movement in India  that influenced him a lot, it could be denial of admission into Osmania Medical College. It may sound odd for a strong persona that George came to represent, but a new biography appropriately titled, 
Jeena hai tho marna seekho
 (learn to die if you want to live) authored by Gita Ramaswamy, brings out this lesser known fact.
A voracious reader of books, George was inspired by A.J. Cronins
The Citadel
and Somerset Maughams
Of Human Bondage
early in his life and wanted to become a doctor. He thought doctors had immense power in relieving people of their suffering and he could do good to others, the modest philosophy that remained etched all through his life that was cut short cruelly at just 25 in a murderous attack by right-wing goons in April 1972.
Having secured second rank in his PUC (Pre-University course) in 1964 and passing with distinction from Nizam College, he was absolutely sure of getting admission into OMC in the first list itself. But he could not make it. When he hadnt made in the second list, his heart sank it hurt him a lothe felt short changed and cheated, the biographer says, quoting his batchmates. The reason given was his non-local status, but the unfair opaque system that denied a medical seat to a deserving candidate, may have triggered the process of questioning society and its mores.
Unlike the present generation of students who turn out to be either good union leaders or brilliant scholars, George excelled in both. Even while building a progressive and democratic student movement in the Osmania Univesity campus and its affiliated colleges, and taking on the ABVP one of whose leading lights Ch. Vidyasagara Rao is now the Maharashtra Governor, he never neglected his studies. A gold medallist in M.Sc, he got admission into prestigious institutions like IIT, Indian Institute of Science and Physical Research Laboratory but preferred to stay back at Osmania University, as the author says, to play bigger part in the revolutionary fight for just and a better society.
Georges angst is visible in Fali Billimorias documentary,
Crisis on the campus,
in 1971: Our society has become rotten. And this rottenness has spread into every facet of our lives including into our universities. Today, we have no other course left to us open now. We have raised our voices in protest. Our protest has remained unheard. We have marched in processions. Our processions have been broken up by police. We have erupted in violence. And our violence has been met with a greater violence. Today, what is left to us but to organise ourselves and meet violence with violence?
Reconstructing and recapitulating a series of 44- year-old episodes that shaped the life and times of a complex person like George, contextualising them could be a tough task. But Gita did it admirably based on long interviews with his comrades. George was indeed complex. He was not just a revolutionary thinker but academic scholar, a pugilist, militant activist, amateur poet, comrade in arms, and defender of the rights of the poor, all rolled into one.
For many in Hyderabad, there will be a feeling of dj vu. Is it wrong to be a socially conscientious student and take up social causes on university campus? Should he be oblivious to the happenings around him? Is it wrong to show dissent, lead and motivate students to a progressive, secular and democratic path on campus? A reader of this inspirational book and the Telugu one written by Katyayini in a much more interesting format is sure to find answers to these questions.

Achhe din likely for taxpayers this Budget | PM helping FM out
AHMEDABAD:  Finance minister Arun Jaitley is likely to introduce some incentives in the  budget that can make the life of the common taxpayer easy. These may include benefits for  housing,  healthcare and  education and some steps to encourage savings and investment.  The finance minister is also expected to lay down a clear road map for implementing his earlier promise of lowering the corporate tax rate to 25%, while balancing this with the exercise of pruning exemptions and deductions for the corporate sector.  Revising limits and reducing rates for tax deduction at source (TDS), rationalizing several TDS procedures and raising monetary limits for maintenance of books of accounts and tax audit also appear to be receiving the attention of the North Block officials engaged in drafting of the  Finance Bill, 2016. These were among the key recommendations of the Justice Easwar Committee appointed by Jaitley.  "Judging by the trend of several taxpayer-friendly administrative measures announced by the CBDT in the past four months, a lot more can be expected in the budget proposals. These could include provisions relating to smoother scrutiny assessments and speedier tax refunds and legislative amendments for curbing undesirable tax litigation," said Mukesh Patel, tax expert and a member of the Justice Easwar Committee.    He said, "While the strings on the FM's purse do appear to be tight, which may restrain him from showering big bounties on taxpayers in  budget 2016, it should turn out to be a win-win situation. By accepting proposals of our committee, the FM can instill a real 'feel-good factor' among the taxpayers without any loss of revenue." By taking these steps, Jaitley is expected to present a budget in line with PM Narendra Modi's vision for 'ease of doing business' and commitment for 'a stable and efficient tax regime'.

TCS increases notice period to three months from March to battle high attrition
MUMBAI:  Tata Consultancy Services, India's largest  IT services company, is raising the  notice period for its Indian  employees to three months starting March, from just a month previously, at a time with the Indian IT sector is grappling with higher attrition.  "The company has reviewed the Notice Period policy and based on employee  feedback and prevailing practices decided to revert to the earlier notice period of 90 days served with effect from March 1, 2016. This will be applicable to India-based employees," Ajoyendra Mukherjee, executive vice president and global head - HR at the company, said in a post on the company's internal site.  TCS has well over 300,000 employees, the overwhelming majority of whom are in India.  Mukherjee added that the notice period was three months until October 2007, when the company decided to change it. ET has seen a copy of the memo.  A TCS spokesperson confirmed the change but declined to comment.  "We do not comment on internal company matters," the spokesperson said in response to ET's call for comment.  As new technologies like digital have fewer employees sufficiently skilled in them, the proportion of lateral hires, and therefore, attrition has been climbing across the Indian IT sector.  TCS has said it will take steps to bring down its attrition rate. At the end of third quarter, TCS had reported an attrition rate of 15.9 per cent, significantly higher than the 12-13 per cent rate it had been operating at two years ago.

Apple escalates encryption fight with US | Yahoo a step closer to possible sale
 WASHINGTON: The US Department of Justice filed a motion on Friday seeking to compel  Apple Inc to comply with a judge's order to unlock the encrypted  iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters, portraying the tech giant's refusal as a "marketing strategy."  In response, a senior Apple executive, speaking with reporters on condition of anonymity, characterized the Justice Department's filing as an effort to argue its case in the media before the company has a chance to respond.  The back and forth escalated a showdown between the Obama administration and  Silicon Valley over security and privacy that ignited earlier this week.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation is seeking the tech company's help to access shooter Syed Rizwan Farook's phone by disabling some of its passcode protections. The company so far has pushed back and on Thursday won three extra days to respond to the order.  Another senior Apple executive said Congress is the right place for a debate over encryption, not a courtroom.  The executive said Apple was stunned that such a legal request had come from the  US government rather than a country with weaker traditions of protecting privacy and civil liberties.  The motion to compel Apple to comply did not carry specific penalties for the company, and the Justice Department declined to comment on what recourse it was willing to seek.  In the order, prosecutors acknowledged that the latest filing was "not legally necessary" since Apple had not yet responded to the initial order.  The clash between Apple and the Justice Department has driven straight to the heart of a long-running debate over how much law enforcement and intelligence officials should be able to monitor digital communications.  A federal court hearing in California has been scheduled for March 22 in the case, according to Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the US Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.  The Justice Department said its Friday motion was a response to Apple CEO Tim Cook's public statement Wednesday, which included a refusal to "hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers."  "Rather than assist the effort to fully investigate a deadly terrorist attack ... Apple has responded by publicly repudiating that order," prosecutors wrote in the Friday filing.  "Apple's current refusal to comply with the court's order, despite the technical feasibility of doing so, instead appears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy," prosecutors said.  ID CHANGE POSES HURDLE The two senior Apple executives said the company had worked hard to help investigators and tried multiple avenues including sending engineers with  FBI agents to a  WiFi network that would recognize the phone and begin an automatic backup if that had been enabled.  They criticized government officials who reset the Apple identification associated with the phone, which closed off the possibility of recovering information from it through that automatic cloud backup.  San Bernardino County reset the password on the  iCloud account at the request of the FBI, said county spokesman David Wert.  The government first disclosed the identification change in a footnote to its filing Friday. The Apple executives said that the reset occurred before Apple was consulted. The Justice Department declined to comment on that contention.  The two sides have been on a collision course since Apple said it would offer strong encryption by default on its devices in 2014, a move prompted in part by the surveillance revelations from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.  But the Justice Department struggled to find a compelling case where encryption proved to be an insurmountable hurdle for its investigators until the Dec. 2 shooting rampage by Farook and his wife in San Bernardino, California, which killed 14. Authorities believe the couple was inspired by the Islamic State.  Some technology experts and privacy advocates backing Apple suggest Farook's work phone likely contains little data of value. They have accused the Justice Department of choreographing the case to achieve a broader goal of gaining support for legislation or a legal precedent that would force companies to crack their encryption for investigators.  The case has quickly become a topic in the US presidential race. Republican frontrunner  Donald Trump on Friday called for a "boycott" against Apple until the company complied with the court order.  The two Apple executives said they felt in good company, noting that Trump has faulted many other groups and individuals.  The debate will also play out on Capitol Hill. Bipartisan leaders of the US House Energy and Commerce Committee late Friday invited Apple's Cook and FBI Director James Comey to testify at an upcoming hearing on encryption, though a date was not set.  The House Judiciary Committee is also planning an encryption hearing for March and has invited Apple to attend, according to a congressional source.

Jats lock Haryana down | Why they are upset
CHANDIGARH: Fresh incidents of violence were today reported in  Haryana as the  Jat stir for quota intensified with protestors torching a railway station in Jind even as the Army conducted a flag march in two curfew-bound districts and used helicopters to reach parts of the blocked  Rohtak district.  As the violence by Jat protestors demanding quota continued unabated, Chief Minister Manohar Khattar issued a fresh appeal to the people to maintain peace.  Normal life was crippled in Rohtak, the epicentre of the ongoing agitation, and Bhiwani in the wake of violence which broke out yesterday during the stir, and many other parts of the state with rail and road traffic hit, and shops and commercial establishment and schools remaining closed.  The Army conducted flag march in Rohtak and Bhiwani today where curfew remained in force.  The Army could not enter Rohtak through road as protesters had put up blockades on Delhi, Hisar, Rohtak, and Fazilka highways, forcing the authorities to air drop them, official said.  As the protest intensified, some unidentified persons set on fire the Budha Khera Railway Station in Jind district this morning.  The furniture, record room and other articles were set on fire at the railway station, which falls in the Jind-Panipat rail section, police said.  Sporadic incidents of violence and arson were reported at several places overnight despite authorities imposing curfew and issuing shoot at sight orders at Rohtak and Bhiwani besides prohibitory orders in Hisar, Jhajjar, Jind, Kaithal and Panipat.  Haryana government had yesterday called the Army in nine districts while curfew was imposed in two districts along with shoot-at-sight orders after one person died and 25 were injured during the Jat stir for quota which turned violent with mobs resorting to widespread arson.  The Centre has also rushed 3,300 personnel of paramilitary forces to control the rampaging mob.  After the Jat reservation turned violent yesterday rampaging mobs had held some policemen captive besides setting ablaze the house of state's Finance Minister Abhimanyu and several government and private properties in Rohtak, Jhajjar, Hansi and several other parts of the state.  Protesters had also targeted police and private vehicles, buildings housing offices, including two Toll Plazas at Hansi in Hisar district and near Rohtak, both located on the Delhi-Hisar-Fazilka National Highway.  The agitating Jats also squatted on the rail tracks in Gurgaon district today, affecting movement of trains.  A Jat protester in Gurgaon said community members want a "written assurance from the government this time. We cannot be befooled with hollow promises every time".  He said Jats did not believe in violence and it was "anti-social" elements who were indulging in such acts to defame the community and to derail their agitation.  Governor Kaptan Singh Solanki had to cancel his function in Gurgaon today, where he was to address a group of women, with an official saying the decision was taken in view of the situation prevailing in the state.  Protesters have also blocked NH-1 near Nangal village in Sonipat district, affecting movement of traffic, which connects Punjab, HP, Chandigarh and J&K.  The protesters have also set on fire a government office in Beri in Jhajjar district besides some vehicles in Safidon.  Meanwhile, Chief Minister  Manohar Lal Khattar has made a fresh appeal to the people to maintain peace and harmony.  "I appeal to all my fellow Haryanvis to maintain law & order in the State, and ensure that harmony is maintained in society," he tweeted.  Khattar had recently held talks with Jat and Khap leaders here, but these failed to bear fruit as the protesters remained adamant on their main demand of OBC quota in government jobs and rejected his announcement of enhancement of the quota of reservation for Economically Backward Classes in the state from 10 to 20 per cent.  Rail services remained badly affected with as many as 37 trains cancelled while 22 have been partially cancelled by the railway authorities.  A number of passenger trains, long distance including super fast passing through or originating in Haryana will remain cancelled today, railway authorities said.  Among the trains which have been cancelled from Chandigarh on Delhi route include the Shatabdi trains and the Himalayan Queen.

'Pak Pathankot probe team may visit India nxt mth'
ISLAMABAD: A team of Pakistani investigators is likely to visit India next month for collecting evidence on the involvement of Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists in the  Pathankot terror attack, a media report said today.  "The team's visit is expected," a senior diplomat told Dawn News, adding that the dates for the trip were yet to be finalised.  The registration of FIR by the Counter-Terrorism Department of Punjab police has paved the way for the visit of the six-member investigation team constituted by Prime Minister  Nawaz Sharif weeks after the attack on the Air Force base in Pathankot on January 2, the report said.  The investigation team will visit the site of the attack and collect evidence on India's assertion that the terror strike was planned in  Pakistan and executed by a group of four persons who had crossed the border into Pathankot, it said.  The report said the visit is likely to take place next month.  The investigators will also meet officials of India's  National Investigating Agency probing the attack, it said.  It also said the FIR will provide a legal basis for taking the investigation forward.  A diplomatic source was quoted as saying that India was ready to receive the Pakistani team and facilitate it in investigations.

India, Nepal sign nine agreements
NEW DELHI: India and  Nepal on Saturday signed nine agreements following delegation-level talks led by Prime Minister  Narendra Modi and his Nepalese counterpart  K.P. Sharma Oli.  "India and Nepal exchange nine agreements for partnership and progress," external affairs ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup tweeted.  These include agreements on utilisation of Indian grant of $250 million for post-earthquake reconstruction, improving of road infrasxtructure in Nepal's Terai area, cultural cooperation, transit between Nepal and  Bagladesh through  Kakarbitta-Banglabandh corridor, operationalisation of  Vishakapatnam port and rail transport to and from Vishakapatnam.  The visit of Oli, who arrived here on Friday, is the first bilateral visit by a prime minister from the Himalayan nation since 2011 when Baburam Bhattarai visited India.  In 2014, then prime minister Sushil Koirala visited India for the swearing-in ceremony of the Narendra Modi-led  National Democratic Alliance ( NDA) government.  In August 2014, Modi paid a bilateral visit to Nepal, the first by an Indian prime minister in 17 years.  Modi again went in November 2014 for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) summit in Kathmandu.  Earlier on Saturday, Oli was accorded a ceremonial welcome at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, where he inspected a guard of honour.  Following this, External Affairs Minister  Sushma Swaraj called on the visiting dignitary.  During the meeting, Oli told Sushma Swaraj that India and Nepal have a natural and civilisational relationship, according to Swarup.  Oli's visit assumes significance as ties between the two South Asian neighbours in the last few months soured after the adoption of a new constitution in the Himalayan nation sparked violent protests in the country's southern plains.

PM greets new government in Arunachal Pradesh
NEW DELHI: A day after a new government was sworn in Arunachal Pradesh, Prime Minister  Narendra Modi today extended best wishes to it and expressed hope that the new dispensation would fulfill the aspirations of the people.  "My best wishes to the new Government of  Arunachal Pradesh in fulfilling the expectations & aspirations of the people," Modi said in a series of tweets.  Dissident Congress leader  Kalikho Pul was sworn in late last night as  Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh after more than two months of political crisis, shortly after the Supreme Court paved the way for government formation and President's rule was lifted from the state.  He also greeted the people of Arunachal Pradesh on its statehood day, saying "I pray for the state's overall development in the coming years."  Modi extended his "best wishes to the wonderful people of  Mizoram on their Statehood Day. May Mizoram scale new heights of progress in the years to come."

1980s: Anti-UK feeling hampered chopper purchase
LONDON: A multi-million pound contract for India to purchase 27 'Westland 30' helicopters in 1980s was overshadowed by "anti-British feelings" in the wake of former prime minister Indira Gandhi's assassination, according to newly declassified documents.  Documents declassified by the National Archives in London yesterday disclose considerable fear within the  Margaret Thatcher Cabinet that India may reverse its purchase plan, which would hit the already struggling UK aircraft firm hard.  "Westland started to manufacture the aircraft. However, there were substantial delays which appeared at least in part to be associated with anti-British feeling in India following Mrs Gandhi's assassination (in 1984)," notes a document dated January 10, 1986, from the defence ministry to the Cabinet Office.  The deal, worth 65 million pounds, has been previously described as the 'Achilles heel' in relations between India and the UK following Gandhi's assassination as her successor,  Rajiv Gandhi, had purported to link it with Britain taking tougher action on pro-Khalistani groups based in the UK.  "Mr Gandhi visited the UK on 15/16 October (1985). During this visit, Ministers had encouraging discussions about the prospects of an Indian order for W 30," a later Cabinet briefing note says.  However, C D Powell, Thatcher's private secretary, writes in another internal dispatch later that year: "Mr Gandhi said that the 'technical chaps' were giving problems. They preferred a French helicopter. The Westland one was too big and consumed more fuel though it was cheaper to operate per seat."  The dubious Westland deal eventually did go ahead but was to be later described by officials involved as a "catastrophic waste of money".  India bought 21 Westland 30s and the money came out of Britain's aid budget and was given to India on condition it bought the helicopters.  The 14-seater Westland 30s proved to be highly unreliable and a commercial disaster and India sold its entire fleet back to Britain for the scrap value of 900,000 pounds after the machines were found to be technically faulty and grounded.  The latest set of documents highlight the considerable chaos caused around the Westland crisis, which led to then  UK defence secretary Michael Heseltine's resignation.

Cong to target 'motormouth' Rajnath in Parliament
NEW DELHI: After Union ministers V K Singh and  Manohar Parrikar,  Congress has indicated it may target home minister  Rajnath Singh in the coming  Parliament session for what the oposition says, his proclivity to quote dreaded terrorists as "gospel".  Singh has landed in the oppostion firing line after he cited a  tweet from Lashkar founder Hafiz Sayeed to back the police crackdown on "anti-India slogans" in JNU. The tweet proclaimed the dreaded Jihadi's support for a JNU meeting, but it was later found to be fake.  Leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad told TOI, "It has become a habit with the home minister. He just shoots off his mouth. This is the third occasion in recent days."  What is riling Congress is Singh's repeated attempts at justifying government's actions or attacking political rivals by quoting terrorists.While the fake Sayeed tweet sharpened the campaign against "anti-national protest", Congress has an axe to grind with the minister over a similar issue.  Singh recently quoted the testimony of David Headley that Ishrat Jehan who was shot in a police encounter in Gujarat was an LeT operative, to demand that Congress apologise to PM  Narendra Modi for maligning him.  "He has the habit of quoting terrorists. He believes Headley. What if tomorrow, Headley says something against BJP. Will he trust him then?" Azad asked.  The Congress veteran recalled that the home minister had declared the Pathankot operation against terrorists to be over, though it actually continued for two more days."The home ministry is a sensitive position, it was held by people like Sardar Patel... it requires gravitas," the senior Congress functionary said. As per indications, Con gress may target Singh as part of its offensive to put the government in the dock over the JNU crackdown. It finds it beneficial to portray Modi ministers as "motormouths" since it helps question the quality of governance. It has used the strategy to subdue MoS V K Singh and defence minister Parrikar in Parliament.

India, US talk carrier tech, but key point off menu
 NEW DELHI: The bilateral strategic clinch may be getting tighter but the US is unwilling to offer help to India in  nuclear propulsion technology for the proposed construction of its largest-ever warship, the 65,000-tonne aircraft carrier INS Vishal.  Follow @ETDefence Twitter handle for comprehensive coverage on other buzzing Defence stories   Even as the joint working group on  aircraft carrier technology cooperation (JWGACTC) met in India from February 15 to 18, top defence ministry sources on Friday said the ongoing bilateral discussions did not include "any nuclear propulsion" for INS Vishal.    The second meeting of the JWGACTC, led by Vice admiral G S Pabby (controller warship production and acquisition) and his American counterpart Rear admiral Thomas J Moore (programme executive officer of aircraft carriers), did discuss various aspects of cooperation in technologies connected to aircraft carriers, including EMALS (electromagnetic aircraft launch systems).  But as per the terms of reference for the  JWGACTC "only conventional propulsion systems" (gas turbines or diesel-electric systems) are under discussion as of now. "The US has its own export control laws... nuclear propulsion is not on the table," said an MoD source.  The Manohar Parrikar-led defence acquisitions council had sanctioned an initial Rs 30 crore as seed money for  INS Vishal in May 2015. Since then, India has issued RFI (request for information) for design consultancy to several foreign shipyards.  But it is felt nuclear propulsion will make better sense for greater operational endurance. For instance, the maximum range of India's 44,500-tonne carrier  INS Vikramaditya is around 7,000 nautical miles. Whereas, the range of an American Nimitz-class supercarrier - the US has 10 of them, all over 100,000 tonnes - is unlimited and it can operate for over 20 years without refueling due to nuclear propulsion.  It will take at least 10-12 years to construct INS Vishal, which is critical towards the plan to build military capabilities to counter China's expanding footprint in the  Indian Ocean Region.

Trump calls for boycott of Apple products amid FBI feud
 WASHINGTON: Republican presidential frontrunner  Donald Trump has called for a boycott of  Apple products until the tech giant agrees to help the FBI unlock the  iPhone of one of the shooters in the San Bernardino attacks.  "Boycott Apple," Trump said at an election campaign rally in South Carolina yesterday, a day before the state holds its crucial Republican primary.  "What I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until such time they give that security number," he said adding, "How do you like that? I just thought of that!"  Trump's call for boycott came after Apple CEO  Tim Cook resisted a US court order to help FBI unlock the phone as part of a probe into last year's San Bernardino attacks, escalating a legal showdown over security and privacy in the US.  Cook describing the demand as "chilling" and called for a public debate over the issue of privacy and security.  "Tim Cook is looking to do a big number, probably to show how liberal he is. Who do they think they are?" Trump asked.  However, soon after calling for the boycott, Trump in a  tweet acknowledged he carries two phones - iPhone and Samsung.  "I use both iPhone & Samsung. If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using  Samsung until they give info," the billionaire real-estate mogul said.  "The phone's not even owned by this young thug that killed all these people. The phone's owned by the government, OK, it's not even his phone," Trump said.  In almost all recent polls, Trump was shown leading by a huge margin against nearest rival Ted Cruz, the Texas Senator.  The Department of Justice yesterday filed a motion to force Apple to unlock the iPhone.  Google and several other IT companies have backed Apple on the issue.

Yahoo to explore sale of company: Is it the beginning of end of a fabled Internet company?
By Vindu Goel and Leslie Picker  In what may turn out to be the beginning of the end of a fabled Internet company,  Yahoo started a formal process Friday that could result in selling all or parts of its business.  The company announced that its board had formed a committee of independent directors to consider strategic options while it continues to pursue a complex plan to split its operating businesses from its 15 per cent stake in Alibaba, the Chinese Internet company.  The move, which Yahoo telegraphed when it reported its financial results early this month, will allow potential bidders to examine its finances and decide whether to make offers for all or part of it. More than a dozen companies and  private equity investors, most prominently Verizon, have expressed preliminary interest in buying at least some of Yahoo.  Shares of Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, California, closed up 2.11 per cent Friday.  Activist investors like Starboard Value have been pushing for a sale of the core business, which includes the company's Web search, email service, sports and financial news, and separately operated services like the  Tumblr blogging network and the Flurry mobile analytics service.  Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's chief executive, has resisted calls for an outright sale. Instead, she has focused on trying to streamline and improve the core business while shaping a tax-free transaction to hand off the company's $25 billion stake in Alibaba to Yahoo shareholders.  Some investors have lost faith in Mayer and her strategy, however. After 3 1/2 years as chief, she has shown little progress in fixing the 21-year-old company, whose many challenges have been a Waterloo for several leaders.  Eric Jackson, managing director of SpringOwl Asset Management, is among those who have been pushing for radical change.  "Things are moving in the right direction, and we're happy about that," he said in an interview Friday.  But he added that it was unclear whether the board would agree to any transactions. Jackson and other investors said they still expected Starboard to field a rival slate of directors for election at Yahoo's annual shareholders' meeting to keep the pressure on the board for a sale.  In a statement Friday, the board said it was "thoroughly committed to exploring strategic alternatives while simultaneously supporting management and the employees in their implementation of Yahoo's strategic plan." It added, "We believe that pursuing these complementary paths is in the best interests of our shareholders and will maximize value."  Yahoo hinted that it would be more interested in selling parts of the business rather than all of it. "In addition to the reverse spin, there are strategic alternatives that could help us achieve the separation, while strengthening our business," Mayer said in a statement.  Some of Yahoo's divisions, such as its small-business services unit, have been designated as tangential to the company's principal business.  Tumblr could also be cleaved off and would be attractive to outside buyers  Facebook was interested in the New York-based blogging service before Yahoo bought it in 2013 for $1.1 billion  but it also helps prop up Yahoo's weak use numbers, especially among young people.  Flurry, the mobile analytics business that Yahoo bought two years ago, also would be appealing. It is used by about 800,000 independent apps and would give a buyer an instant entry with software developers. But Yahoo has been integrating its ad sales technology with Tumblr, and unwinding that would be complex.  Robert Peck, an Internet analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said  Wall Street was unlikely to be satisfied with a few asset sales.  "By far, what investors want and will push for is the cleanest, fastest solution that optimizes value, and that is selling the core," Peck said.  The board has tapped financial advisers, including  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Paul J. Taubman's firm, PJT Partners, and the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, to help with the review process.  The committee will recommend to the board what it determines to be the best transaction  if one exists.  The company declined to make any other additional disclosures about the sales process.

Apple's refusal to unlock iPhone a 'marketing strategy': US Justice Dept
WASHINGTON: The Justice Department, frustrated by its inability to unlock the  iPhone of one of the attackers in the  San Bernardino killings, demanded Friday that a judge immediately order  Apple to give it the technical tools to get inside the phone.  Apple's refusal "appears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy" rather than a legal rationale, prosecutors said in a court filing that further escalated the confrontation between the Obama administration and Apple.  "This is not the end of privacy," the Justice Department declared, a mocking reference to Apple's rationale for contesting the court order prosecutors obtained from a judge directing Apple to help them break into the phone.  The sharply worded, 25-page motion to compel Apple's cooperation seemed aimed as much at swaying public opinion as influencing the federal magistrate judge in Riverside, California, who issued the order to Apple.  A blistering open letter this week from Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, had rallied many privacy advocates behind the company, and law enforcement officials said that the latest volley from the Justice Department on Friday was meant largely to rebut Cook's arguments and buttress the government's own case.  Apple executives, speaking with reporters after the filing on the condition that they not be identified by name, said they were puzzled by the Justice Department's decision to rush back into court before the company even had a chance to respond to this week's court order.  They reiterated their concerns that the government's novel demands would endanger the privacy and security of all of their iPhone customers in the future, and said they remained determined to fight the government's demands.  Apple has until next week to respond to an order by a California magistrate this week compelling it to provide the technical assistance that the FBI says it needs to get into the phone.  But the Justice Department sought to pre-empt Apple's response with its own filing Friday, saying Apple has already made its opposition publicly known and that the "urgency of this investigation" demands faster action.  "Rather than assist the effort to fully investigate a deadly terrorist attack by obeying this court's order," prosecutors wrote, "Apple has responded by publicly repudiating that order."  They went on to accuse Apple of exaggerating how difficult it would be for the company's computer engineers to come up with a way to get into the phone and to disable an "auto-erase" feature that permanently deletes the data inside after 10 failed password attempts.  "At no point has Apple ever said that it does not have the technical ability to comply with the order or that the order asks Apple to undertake an unreasonably challenging software development task," prosecutors wrote. "On this point, Apple's silence speaks volumes."  The Justice Department wants to force Apple to write software that would allow the government to try millions of random password combinations to get into the phone.  Apple has described this as an unprecedented demand, one that would require the company's engineers to build a new operating system from scratch and effectively hack into its own phone.  The Justice Department said that was a significant overstatement. Prosecutors said the technology was no more difficult than passing a new software update to the phone  something the company does regularly.  Apple executives acknowledged Friday that it was technically possible but said it was still unwarranted for the government to demand it to create something that did not exist.  In his 1,100-word letter to his customers early Wednesday, Cook said what prosecutors were demanding amounted to forcing Apple to create a "back door" to get around its own security protocols, and he vowed a fight. He accused the Justice Department of mounting a "chilling" attack on privacy and Internet security.  Apple has taken a strong stand on privacy not only because of Cook's strong personal beliefs on the issue, but also because the company's business model encourages a bolder stance. Unlike other Silicon Valley tech giants, Apple's business has a straightforward hardware model that hinges on selling physical devices like iPhones, iPads and Macs. Other tech companies, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, depend more on the online collection of large amounts of consumer data for their digital advertising-oriented businesses.  With this week's dispute generating wide attention on Capitol Hill, Republican and Democratic leaders from the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent letters to Apple and the FBI on inviting their executives to testify publicly on the issue at a hearing.  The lawmakers wrote in a joint letter that the public debate over encryption and its impact on law enforcement investigations "has now come to a critical juncture" with this week's order regarding the iPhone 5c used by Syed Farook in an attack in December that resulted in 14 deaths.  The Justice Department's latest filing Friday also offered new details about the unsuccessful negotiations between Apple and the government to resolve the encryption on their own before the dispute became public this week.  Among other steps, the two sides discussed options that included using data backed up to the iCloud, other backup computers, separately held toll records or other databases to capture the information held in the cellphone. But for a variety of reasons, the FBI concluded, none of those options would work. Among other problems, the default system that backed up the phone on the  iCloud had been disabled  apparently by Farook  in October, six weeks before the shootings.  In its filing, the Justice Department suggested repeatedly that Apple has put its "marketing concerns" above its corporate responsibility to comply with a lawful order to assist law enforcement.  "Apple is not above the law in that regard," the filing said.

Japan fund makes late move to thwart Hon Hai in Sharp battle: Sources
 TOKYO: A Japanese state fund is making a final effort to secure a takeover of  Sharp Corp as the ailing electronics maker considers a higher $5.8 billion offer from Taiwan's  Foxconn, criticising the composition of the company's board, sources said.  Innovation Network Corporation of Japan (INCJ) officials are taking issue with two of Sharp's board members who they believe have a conflict of interest as they represent a fund that holds preferred shares in the  electronics company, according to the sources familiar with the fund's complaint.  Sharp earlier this month said it would focus on takeover talks with Taiwan's Foxconn, despite widespread expectations that INCJ's rescue plan would be backed.  INCJ officials believe the two board members who represent the fund holding preferred shares are more inclined to favour a deal with Foxconn, known formally as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, because INCJ has proposed that the preferred shares be cancelled in exchange for a bailout.  The fund has raised its concerns with the Sharp board, said the sources, who declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak with media.  INCJ Chief Strategy Officer Tetsuya Hamabe, however, said it was not true that the fund had criticised the composition of Sharp's board.  Sharp declined to comment.  Sharp board members are due to meet on Saturday, although it is not clear whether they will make a final decision on Hon Hai's offer, another source said.  INCJ had offered to  invest 300 billion yen ($2.6 billion) in the struggling electronics maker, less than a half of 659 billion yen investment proposed by Foxconn. INCJ had planned to combine its display business with that of rival Japan Display Inc, in which the fund holds a majority stake.

Britain's Cameron takes home 'special status' EU deal
LONDON: Prime Minister  David Cameron takes a deal giving Britain "special status" in the EU back to London on Saturday hoping it will be enough to keep his country in the bloc as campaigning begins for a crucial in-out referendum.  The British premier is expected to announce a date for the vote, likely June 23, after sealing unanimous support for the agreement during two days and nights of intense negotiations in Brussels.  Cameron will hold a cabinet meeting at 1000 GMT on Saturday, after which the referendum campaign will whirr into life, with ministers who want Britain to leave the  European Union being allowed to speak out for the first time.  "I've negotiated a deal to give the UK  special status in the European Union," Cameron told a press conference on Friday evening.  "I will be campaigning with all my heart and soul to persuade the British people to remain in the reformed European Union that we have secured today."  He said the deal contained a seven-year "emergency brake" on welfare payments for EU migrants and meant Britain would be "permanently out of ever closer union".  While Britain's place in the EU now rests in the hands of the British public, the deal relieves some of the pressure on Brussels as it grapples with the biggest migration crisis in Europe's history.  EU president  Donald Tusk, who brokered the agreement, said the "unanimous" deal "strengthens Britain's special status in the EU" and was "legally binding and irreversible".  - 'Depressingly negative campaign' -  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel, Europe's most powerful leader, said the accord was a "fair compromise".  "I do not think that we gave too much to  Great Britain," she said.  French President Francois Hollande insisted the deal contained "no exceptions to the rules" of the EU, but Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi warned "there is a risk of us losing sight of the original European dream".  The euro and British pound gained after the announcement, with the single currency rising to $1.1131 in New York, from $1.1105 Thursday, and the pound to $1.4392 from $1.4335.  Yet the drama is only just beginning for Cameron, as he battles eurosceptic members of his own Conservative Party and scepticism within the British media.  Britain's newspapers went to press shortly before the deal was officially announced, and most of Saturday's editions focussed on the expected announcement that Cameron's long-time ally  Michael Gove was to support a "Brexit".  The Guardian, Daily Telegraph, and Independent all carried front-page pictures of the former education secretary, while the eurosceptic Daily Express ran with headline: "Gove to lead us out of EU."  Opinion polls suggest the British public is finely balanced on whether to back a Brexit.  Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King's College London, said he expected both sides to emphasise the risks of either leaving or sticking with the status quo.  "This is going to be a depressingly negative campaign," he told AFP.  - Headaches at home -  During negotiations, France and Belgium strongly resisted safeguards for countries that do not use the euro.  European Commission chief  Jean-Claude Juncker said the deal would give Britain no power of veto over the eurozone.  Britain and other "euro-outs" will, however, be able to raise concerns about eurozone policies at the level of EU summits.  Meanwhile, Eastern European countries dug in their heels over restrictions on benefit payments to EU migrants that they deemed discriminatory and in violation of the bloc's principle of freedom of movement.  Brussels offered an "emergency brake" which would allow Britain to limit welfare payments if its system is overwhelmed by the inflow of workers.  Cameron now faces fresh political headaches at home as key allies, including London Mayor  Boris Johnson, make up their minds whether to back the prime minister or throw in their lot with the 'No' camp.  On Monday, his government is expected to table measures in the Houses of Parliament to set the date for the vote.  This will be Britain's second referendum on European membership in just over 30 years.  In June 1975, voters backed membership of the then European Economic Community (EEC) by just over 67 per cent.

No cyber attack response strategy at most Indian companies
MUMBAI: Most top executives at  Indian companies have no strategy to react to a cyberattack, cyber war games held earlier this year by consultancy EY showed.  EY ran a  cyber attack simulation for 79 CEOs sitting in one room and they struggled to come to a consensus on whom to call first if their firm was hacked. The simulation asked top executives at a slew of companies how they would react to a message from someone saying their customer database had been hacked and put on the Internet. The simulation went through several steps and tabulated responses.  "We had CEOs who said they would call their chief information security officers to check if they had truly been hacked, others said they would call their chief marketing officer, some said they would call their corporate communications officer. And there was the realization that there was no agreement," Burgess Cooper, partner-information security at EY, told ET.  Cooper said the point of the war games was that people always learnt more from event they experience rather than just having a standard operating procedure.  He added that several executives did not even realize that some things a  hacker might ask them to do to save their data was illegal. "One scenario was that the hacker tries to ransom your data. Some didn't realize that paying such a ransom was illegal. Then there were questions off how to buy bitcoins, because such ransoms aren't paid in cash," Cooper said. "They realized they had no strategy. They are now looking at putting that in place." EY has separately run the cyber resilience war games for about 20 ecommerce chief financial officers, a large IT company, a telecom company and an equipment maker.  Indian companies have been boosting expenditure on cyber security but, as yet, several lack processes to cope with a breach. The lack of response strategy is at a time when cyberatttacks on Indian firms are growing exponentially, according to experts.

Microsoft urges Indian govt to use cloud, data units
NEW DELHI:  Microsoft has urged the government to consider using its  cloud offerings and data centres for projects such as those involving stateowned enterprises, banking and smart cities.  Microsoft chief legal officer Brad Smith met communications and information technology minister  Ravi Shankar Prasad, who said the government will be open to using the company's products as long as it approaches the relevant authorities through proper procedures and ensures that security concerns are addressed, according to a person familiar with the discussions.  Microsoft did not immediately respond to an email query seeking comment. Microsoft launched local data centres in India in September, offering its Azure cloud services and commercial Office 365 services, as the company sought to build up confidence in the products among the government, Indian companies and small and medium businesses in the country.  "When we think about the cloud opportunity in India itself, it is going to be a $2 trillion opportunity," Microsoft chief executive  Satya Nadella had said at the launch of the data centres.  The ruling BJP has in the past asked multinational corporations to set up local data centres to maintain data sovereignty and a large number of Indian enterprises have increasingly voiced concerns about hosting their data on the public cloud due to security concerns.  Setting up of local data centres by Microsoft was seen as an important development, especially for data-sensitive industries such as banking and e-governance projects. Smith also discussed the progress of its white space technology project to provide free Internet connectivity, which the technology giant has been testing in India since last year. Microsoft had proposed that it be provided spectrum free of cost for the testing phase.  At Friday's meeting, the minister is learnt to have said that the government will decide on using white space technology after evaluating the pilot programme.  "The ministry will take a call on the project provided security concerns are met. The minister asked Microsoft to look at developing alternative technologies to take broadband to the inaccessible areas of the country," the person said.

Has Apple toppled Samsung in Indias market for pricey smartphones?
KOLKATA | NEW DELHI: Has  Apple toppled  Samsung in India's market for pricey phones? The verdict appears to be two to one in favour of the US company. Counterpoint Research and CyberMedia Research rank Apple at No. 1 by volume in the Rs 30,000-plus category for the October-December quarter. Sales tracker Gfk says the South Korean company is still ahead.  Apple has trailed Samsung in the category for three quarters but record sales in the last quarter appear to have tipped the balance for the Tim Cook-led company.  Counterpoint Research said Apple gained a 55% volume share of the segment compared with Samsung's 35%. Cybermedia puts the US company's share at 61.4% and that of Samsung at 25.9%. According to GfK, Samsung's share of the market was 49.4% in towns with a population of 50,000 and above and Apple's was 41%.  Samsung has said it remains India's No. 1 in the segment while Apple didn't comment.  "Apple initially faltered in their sales of new iPhones during the first month of launch due to the high price," said the chief of a leading cellphone retail chain. But it recovered by introducing discounts and buyback offers, he said. Samsung countered with promotions.  "It was almost neck and neck in the latter part of the quarter," he said. Tarun Pathak, senior analyst with Counterpoint, backed this view. "Aggressive marketing campaign during Diwali helped it gain momentum and leapfrog Samsung," he said, adding that by value, Apple had captured 58% of the premium segment followed by Samsung at 36%.  A Samsung Southwest Asia spokesperson said the company has consistently led the category. "We were again the market leader in this segment in last quarter and our success was fuelled by iconic products launched in 2015, including the flagship devices  Samsung Galaxy S6,  Galaxy S6 edge,  Galaxy S6 edge+ and Galaxy Note 5, as well as by the stylish A series offering best-in-class smartphone experience," he said.  Counterpoint and CyberMedia track shipment numbers or the quantity of units despatched to dealers and retailers. GfK tracks sales at the retail end. All units shipped to dealers may not necessarily get sold and some inventory may remain in the channel.  INDIA KEY BATTLEFIELD India is a key battlefield in the global tussle between the brands as they seek to drive up sales. According to Gartner, Apple lost 2.7% global market share while Samsung gained 0.8% in the October-December quarter from the year earlier. In the January-September period last year, Samsung was ahead in the  Indian market with 55% share compared with Apple's 37%, according to Counterpoint Research. Both brands are set to launch new devices.  Samsung will debut its new flagship Galaxy S7 on Sunday at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Analysts expect it will be available in India within a few weeks, the quickest of launch windows for such a device. There's also speculation that Apple will unveil a new 4-inch iPhone specially designed for emerging markets such as India next month.  Apple has stepped up promotional schemes for the  iPhone 6s and 6s Plus while Samsung has launched new devices such as the Galaxy A7 2016 edition in the Rs 30,000-plus range.  "The current quarter will be a tough fight between Samsung and Apple, especially since new launches are lined up and traditionally during this time smartphone sales slow down," said Counterpoint Research's Pathak.  While the overall Indian smartphone market grew 15% in the October-December quarter, the premium handset market grew 40%, according to Counterpoint. The premium segment is just 4% of the total market and Samsung and Apple together control almost 90% of it. Other top players in the segment are Sony,  HTC and Lenovo.  In calendar 2015, the Korean major led the premium smartphone segment with a 46.1% share, with Apple at 43.8%, CyberMedia said. October-December was Apple's best-ever quarter in India with over 800,000 iPhones sold, Counterpoint said. The iPhone 6s series accounted for about half of this and the iPhone 5s about 30%.  Counterpoint's Pathak estimates the size of premium segment to double in 2016, but its contribution to overall handset market will remain in single digits by volume. By revenue, the premium segment contributes 25% to overall sales.

Budget to focus on poor, progress, jobs: Jayant Sinha
NEW DELHI: The uplift of the poor, progress of farmers and employment for the youth will be the focus of the upcoming budget, Minister of State for Finance  Jayant Sinha said in a Youtube post on Saturday.  "This budget will be a forward-looking budget that will ensure that India will continue to be a haven of stability and growth in a very turbulent and choppy global  environment," he said in a rare message ahead of the annual exercise.  Sinha had also said in a tweet on Friday that the present government has managed to kept prices in check. "The NDA government has been successful in contain  inflation," he said, adding this was far less than the pace during the previous UPA regime.  Earlier, his boss and  Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also spoke about facilitating tax payers.  The use of technology has gone a long way in helping taxpayers with 1.4 crore assessees notified and also paid their refunds using this medium, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said, ahead of the budget presentation for the next fiscal year.  "The government has been increasing using technology for the advantage of all tax payers and 1.4 crore, that is assessees, have been notified of their refunds and refunds have been given to them also using this very medium," Jaitley said.

Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan set up Special Purpose Vehicles for Smart Cities
NEW DELHI:  Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have set up  Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) for the development of Smart Cities.  "The Ministry of  Urban Development has been informed that SPVs have been set up for Jabalpur, Indore and  Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh and Jaipur and Udaipur in Rajasthan," an official release said.

Budget 2016 may offer sops for housing, healthcare, education
AHMEDABAD:  Finance minister Arun Jaitley is likely to introduce some incentives in the  budget that can make the life of the common taxpayer easy. These may include benefits for  housing,  healthcare and  education and some steps to encourage savings and investment.  The finance minister is also expected to lay down a clear road map for implementing his earlier promise of lowering the corporate tax rate to 25%, while balancing this with the exercise of pruning exemptions and deductions for the corporate sector.  Revising limits and reducing rates for tax deduction at source (TDS), rationalizing several TDS procedures and raising monetary limits for maintenance of books of accounts and tax audit also appear to be receiving the attention of the North Block officials engaged in drafting of the  Finance Bill, 2016. These were among the key recommendations of the Justice Easwar Committee appointed by Jaitley.  "Judging by the trend of several taxpayer-friendly administrative measures announced by the CBDT in the past four months, a lot more can be expected in the budget proposals. These could include provisions relating to smoother scrutiny assessments and speedier tax refunds and legislative amendments for curbing undesirable tax litigation," said Mukesh Patel, tax expert and a member of the Justice Easwar Committee.    He said, "While the strings on the FM's purse do appear to be tight, which may restrain him from showering big bounties on taxpayers in  budget 2016, it should turn out to be a win-win situation. By accepting proposals of our committee, the FM can instill a real 'feel-good factor' among the taxpayers without any loss of revenue." By taking these steps, Jaitley is expected to present a budget in line with PM Narendra Modi's vision for 'ease of doing business' and commitment for 'a stable and efficient tax regime'.

Budget 2016 must ease tax rules: Girish Vanvari
By Girish Vanvari  The global economic outlook seems uncertain. With oil prices tumbling, a slowdown in the Chinese  economy and devaluation of yuan, a general question today is what might be the potential impact on India. With the current Indian demography and a stable government at the centre, India has the potential to capitalise on this opportunity.  Budget 2016 needs to focus on simplifying  tax regulations and provide for increasing the rural demand for goods and services, attracting foreign investment, facilitating  Indian corporates in their expansion plan and lay the ground for an export conducive environment.  To start with we can expect a reduction in the corporate tax base rate of 30%. Earlier, the government had proposed to phase out the profit-linked incentives from April 2017.  Given the need to attract foreign investment and push corporates towards expansion, the government may want to reconsider and defer this phase-out plan. Further, with the reducing difference between the base corporate tax rate and MAT base rate, such tax holidays may not be very attractive.  There is a need to streamline MAT regime. Next, the focus should be on simplifying the tax regime. Currently,  taxation, with its many areas, is subject to multiple interpretations. There are many industry-wide tax issues wherein different officers in different jurisdictions have taken various positions.  The government needs to set up a panel which would address specific industry issues. The government should consider the recommendations issued by the Easwar committee whose report suggests the simplification/deletion of various provisions under the Indian tax law, namely provisions relating to definition of a capital asset, disallowances of expenses relating to exempt income, deferment of the Income Computation and Disclosure Standards (ICDS), resolving practical difficulties in obtaining a lower deduction under Section 197 of the Income-tax Act, grant of a timely refund with interest and so on. If these suggestions are implemented, it is expected to bring in certainty in the tax laws. Further, there is a need to increase the tax base.  Declaration under The Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 saw a tepid response. An out-of-the-box approach is required for bringing this out of the books money under the tax net.  We also see a need to align to some global practices. Finalising the guidelines on the principles of determining the Place of Effective Management (POEM) of a company would be on radar.    (Views expressed are personal.

Unlike predecessors, PM Modi actively involved in Budget-making
NEW DELHI: With less than 10 days to go before its presentation in Parliament, Finance Minister  Arun Jaitley and his team are busy putting together what's expected to be a landmark Budget. Prime Minister  Narendra Modi and key officials in his office are also as closely engaged in the exercise. ET spoke to various officials to piece together how Budget-making under this government is proving to be very different from what it used to be.  Indian prime ministers generally set a broad direction for the Budget, leaving finance ministers to work out the details. Modi has shown through his tenure and even before that that he isn't such a leader, being as focused on the nitty gritty as he is on the big picture. During his three terms as chief minister of Gujarat, he was as closely involved in policy-making. One bureaucrat recalled how the PM sat through a three-hour presentation, reflecting his keen interest in policy-making.  Additionally, the world's attention is focused on India, which has not only taken on the mantle of fastest growing major  economy but is also seen as the sole bright spot amid worldwide gloom and uncertainty, according to the latest  OECD report that was published on Thursday.          Those who know him well aren't surprised at Modi's ability to absorb details that others may consider tedious, given the kind of engagement the PM has with secretaries and how hands-on he is-.Besides, there are many significant decisions that require his input, such as the  fiscal deficit, for one. Should the government relax its fiscal consolidation targets to keep public expenditure high or stay the course for more long-term gains? Other queries are more political in nature, such as the rationalisation of subsidies or a package to address rural stress. ET had reported on February 15 that the government is working on a twin-pronged Budget that will push structural reform to lift growth and address rural stress through broader social security measures and changes in agricultural policy.  EVALUATING PROPOSALS With the Budget scheduled to be announced on February 29, Modi and Jaitley are evaluating proposals to pick those that will make a difference.  "The PM and FM examine broadsheets and decisions are accordingly taken," said an official involved in the preparation of the Budget.  The term 'broadsheet' refers to the list of proposals that are put up for consideration by the finance ministry before the highest decision-makers.  After initial filtering by officials in the finance ministry, the broadsheet is vetted by the finance minister and finalised after deliberations with the prime minister. Last month, just when the Budget exercise was picking up pace, the prime minister had set up eight groups of secretaries to conduct brainstorming sessions and come up with ideas. Some of these may find their way into the Budget after being endorsed by the prime minister, said a senior official.  SEAMLESS EXCHANGE OF IDEAS There is a close and seamless exchange of ideas between North Block and South Block, said another official.  This is a big change from the gulf that seemed to exist during the previous government, suggested some ministry veterans, pointing to the retrospective tax amendment as being the result of such distance.  South Block, which houses the Prime Minister's Office, has been holding regular meetings with North Block officials to thrash out Budget details. As chief minister of Gujarat, Modi was known to have a keen eye for the nuts and bolts of policy that would make the process of execution effective, which was his forte.  The Budget interactions have been centred on some of the key issues that the government is grappling with, including its initiative to simplify and rationalise the tax structure, boost the rural economy and kickstart the investment cycle.  Proposals such as the creation of a bad bank that will take on the rotten assets of state-run lenders and thereby leave them with a clean balance sheet are understood to have some PMO support and there have been several rounds of discussions on the matter. Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan hasn't been much in favour of this, suggesting that there didn't seem to be a need to create another government-backed institution to take on bad loans when the lenders in question were state-owned anyway.  The Modi-led Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, which has emerged as the launch pad for a revamped social security programme, is expected to be loaded further with new initiatives as the government looks to make optimum use of the financial inclusion initiative.

And you thought D-St is nervous about Budget 2016? Whos who buzzing with ideas
MUMBAI:  Dalal Street is shorn of the usual pre-budget euphoria this time around. Instead, a sense of despondency and nervousness hangs in the air. For the first time in many years the market is confused about what is in store in the Budget and no one knows what will happen on the taxation front. As anxiety grows, participation has gone down in the market and the stocks have turned volatile even when things are looking up globally.  Yet, the who's who on Dalal Street are hopeful that the Modi government will deliver a Budget that will create demand in the economy and spark growth, which will eventually make the market change its trajectory.  (For minute-by-minute market/stock updates, follow our Twitter handle @ETMarkets)  However, no one seems to be ready to accept any compromise on fiscal prudence in order to meet the pressing needs for money to raise pay, recapitalise banks and increase capital investment.  "Fiscal consolidation must continue. There is no reason to abandon that path." Ridham Desai, Managing Director, Morgan Stanley India, told an elite gathering of the Mumbai financial world at the ETMarkets pre-Budget round table on Friday.  "Further fiscal consolidation is an imperative. It has brought in great rewards. Instead of abandoning it, the government must rationalise expenditure and subsidies," he suggested, cautioning that global investors might take a dim view of any more aggressive focus to push growth.  Desai believes growth is returning to the economy. What is missing is earnings growth, which has a lot to do with persistent PPI (producer's price index) deflation, something he identified as the single largest problem that the government needs to fix. He said a singular focus on recapitalising PSU banks, instead of scattered spending, can help the economy bounce back faster.  Recapitalisation of PSU banks is a big theme in this year's Budget and, at the same event, State Bank of India Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya advocated the need for that and also the urgency to amend the relevant Act to bring down government stake in PSBs below 51%, which will allow many banks to raise funds from the market.  Neelkanth Mishra, India Equity Strategist for Credit Suisse, doesn't expect the allocation under this head to go up significantly from Rs 25,000 crore or Rs 40,000 crore levels, as there is "no clarity on how big is the hole really is, which banks are at risk, how much loss they are staring at and how to really go about addressing the problem. Mishra, instead, said the market and investors will focus more on the nature of spending. "If the government increase spending, taxes will also go up and that way the overall fiscal impact will be zero," he said.  The trick will be in the government's ability to find resources and spend them on the growth-stimulating areas, Mishra said.  Nilesh Shah, MD of Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund, said the government should focus more on monetising assets instead of depending on borrowing or raising taxes. "It may not be possible to divest a PSU, but you can always divest in, say, SUUTI or Hind Zinc. When the government first divested Hindustan Zinc, its quarterly profit was Rs 300 crore, today it has gone up to Rs 2,000 crore. The government can think of divesting companies like that, and that resources can then be used in a better way." Plus, the government has to reduce wastage of money on  gold imports, which averages $22 billion a year. A 2 per cent wealth tax on gold holding above a certain limit, including those held by religious institution, can bring out a lot of  bullion for recycling and reduce imports, said Shah. His other out-of-the box idea for the Budget were to target black money in  real estate and gold, by using a private agency to actively take over undervalued or under-declared real estate property on a profit-sharing basis. When it comes to the speculation about possible tweaking of the long-term capital gains tax, Dalal Street is actually rather indifferent.  "There were all kinds of talk when the LTCG was changed for debt funds last year, but it has settled down pretty well in less than a year. But the problem is with certain dichotomy that exits in the taxation pattern. For instance, in debt funds now it is three years but in case of debt securities it's still one year. That is a bigger problem," said S Naren, CIO, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund.  On a broader note, Naren wants to see the government focus on growth instead of raising taxes, which he said would come anyway once growth picks up. With a $75 billion bonanza on the oil front, and fiscal deficit at the lowest point in many years on a rolling basis, the government has a lot of legroom to look at a big growth push. He said the UDAY scheme, if successful, will help banks a lot and even bank recapitalisation will eventually help faster growth as the money will flow back to the economy. "Growth has to be kickstarted by the government,  India Inc in no position to do so," he said.  Prashant Jain, Executive Director and CIO, HDFC Mutual Fund, refuses to buy the idea that the market has anything to do with budget. "It is wrong to link budget and market," he insists.  Jain doesn't believe India's fiscs are really under pressure. He says the revenue side is pretty good and the capex push is already coming from roads, railways, T&D and mining, bulk of which is being funded by the government. He expects government capex to go up further this year.  S Naganath, President and CIO of DSP BlackRock Investment Managers, said he is bullish that the budget will help spark growth, which will eventually help the market to find its feet.

Market has found its bottom, it's going to be the way up from here on, say D-St honchos
MUMBAI: So, the market has found its bottom in the 1,600-point fall seen last week. That's the view coming from the horses' mouths on Dalal Street.  Market mavens, who joined a rare gathering of financial market honchos at the ETMarkets Pre-Budget Meet in Mumbai on Friday evening, squarely projected a bullish view for the domestic economy and market, saying what's happening in our market has very less to do with domestic issues and more to do with global problems.  (For minute-by-minute market/stock updates, follow our Twitter handle @ETMarkets)  "Almost 50-60 per cent of  Sensex has nothing to do with India," declared star fund manager Prashant Jain of HDFC Mutual Fund, as he tried to argue that global issues are to blame for much of the ills afflicting the domestic market.  Jain said  Indian economy is in a transition phase. "India Inc's profits are at a cyclical low. That's because there has been a slowdown in consumption, which is again because penetration levels of consumer staples companies have gone down. And low  inflation has taken away profits. Plus, the tailwind of the commodities crash is not fully visible yet," Jain said.  He said profit growth trends should emerge in 3-4 quarters and after a long period of depressed earnings,  India Inc should see above-trend profit growth for three-four years. "The growth has to come from capex cycle, and capex revival will not come from manufacturing companies but from roads, railways, mining, T&D and defence sectors, where a lot of government investment has already been made."  S Naren of ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund said the market at the moment is offering great value. "There are some pockets which are not very cheap. Many of the midcaps are still not as cheap as they were in 2007, but many have fallen to attractive levels. Many of the MNC stocks, the so-called quality at any cost basket, have not corrected meaningfully. And smallcaps are not at all cheap. But largecaps are really cheap. So keep buying when the headlines are bad," he said.  For long, crude and  Nifty have enjoyed good positive correlation, though the huge savings on the oil account has come as a big bonanza for the domestic economy. That's what gives Neelkanth Mishra of Credit Suisse a lot of hope about an imminent revival in the domestic stock market.  "A double-digit growth in oil demand, the rise in Bitumen demand, a steady surge in credit growth are all pointing towards a rising growth momentum in the economy," Mishra proclaimed.  Nilesh Shah, MD of Kotak Mutual Fund, said India has been paying the price of going down with China even when one thought China's pain will be India's gain. "While FIIs' India allocation remains strong at 10-15 per cent and we are receiving flows, there has been outflow from emerging market funds because of the problems in China and that has led to FII selling in India as well. Once risk-on trade resumes, India should start witnessing more flows," he said.  Morgan Stanley's Ridham Desai, though, has a different prognosis of what's really ailing our market.  "When the US Fed raised rates in December, it was reacting to domestic economic triggers. But it also took the dollar up. Which eventually caused a 100 basis points tightening in the US economy, and that's what has left global markets in a mess and the US central bank between a rock and a hard place," said Desai He said for India, sentiment indicators are showing a full-house buy signal, which is unprecedented.  "We probably saw the bottom last week. Having said that, yes the world is risky and we will keep seeing volatility," said Desai. He said India bore the brunt of being a high quality market. "We were probably the last man standing."  Desai said while there has been close to $90 billion outflow from emerging markets, FIIs remain overweight on India and may have lightened only some bit of late. "Our problem is not who is selling, but the fact that there is no buyer. The buyers' strike has to end for the domestic market to revive," he said.  S Nagnath, President and CIO of DSP BlackRock Mutual Fund, projects India Inc's earnings growth to shoot up to 15 per cent level within three to four quarters. "Whatever earnings downgrades had to happen have happened. The benefit of crude and commodity crash is still not fully visible. The hit from bank NPAs will fall in a quarter or so. So if rains are normal and rural demand picks up, it will lead to double-digit profit earnings growth and the market will also begin to look as good as the macros," he said.

Is the money to be made in this market? Sectors where D-Street mavens see value
MUMBAI: Where is the money, honey! If you are an equity investor, top fund managers have easy answers for you.  Equity is the place to be in, says S Naren, Chief Investment Officer of ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund. Naren said one has to keep investing in the market. "Use this opportunity to make money in the make this year. If you are invested 20-30 per cent now, but the end of the year, you should be fully invested," he said at an elite gathering of financial market professionals at the ET Markets Pre-Budget Meet in Mumbai on Friday night.  (For minute-by-minute market/stock updates, follow our Twitter handle @ETMarkets)  But Nilesh Shah of Kotak Mutual Fund sounded the most bullish among them all. "The market has to rally from here on. In 2005,  Sensex was where  Nifty is now. In 10 years, Nifty will be where Sensex is now."  S Naganath, President and CIO of DSK BlackRock Mutual Fund, identified consumer discretionary, industrials and capital goods as actionable investment ideas at this stage. "Even banks should do well once the ongoing pain gets over," he said.  Ridham Desai of Morgan Stanley India finds consumption a better bet. "Even industrials look like an attractive value proposition along with some of the private banks. But global energy and commodity plays look tricky and one should try to avoid them," he said.  Neelkanth Mishra of Credit Suisse bets on NBFCs, which he said should see strong growth and gain from the banks' unwillingness to fully pass on the rate cuts. His two other big bets include consumer staples and discretionary.  Prashant Jain of HDFC Mutual Fund said investors who are willing to think long term and who can think against the consensus will make money in this market. He said the market setup at the moment looks like what it was in 2003 and the business and capex cycle of the economy are going to surprise investors on the upside this year, thereby lifting the market to a much higher level.  But Morgan Stanley's Ridham Desai has a warning: Forget big returns in  equities for some time! "It's a low-return world. Since the days of 15-16 per cent growth, the world has become very different now. Those high-return days will probably never come in next 10-15 years. India should still do better," he said.

India, Nepal sign nine agreements
NEW DELHI: India and  Nepal on Saturday signed nine agreements following delegation-level talks led by Prime Minister  Narendra Modi and his Nepalese counterpart  K.P. Sharma Oli.  "India and Nepal exchange nine agreements for partnership and progress," external affairs ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup tweeted.  These include agreements on utilisation of Indian grant of $250 million for post-earthquake reconstruction, improving of road infrasxtructure in Nepal's Terai area, cultural cooperation, transit between Nepal and  Bagladesh through  Kakarbitta-Banglabandh corridor, operationalisation of  Vishakapatnam port and rail transport to and from Vishakapatnam.  The visit of Oli, who arrived here on Friday, is the first bilateral visit by a prime minister from the Himalayan nation since 2011 when Baburam Bhattarai visited India.  In 2014, then prime minister Sushil Koirala visited India for the swearing-in ceremony of the Narendra Modi-led  National Democratic Alliance ( NDA) government.  In August 2014, Modi paid a bilateral visit to Nepal, the first by an Indian prime minister in 17 years.  Modi again went in November 2014 for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) summit in Kathmandu.  Earlier on Saturday, Oli was accorded a ceremonial welcome at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, where he inspected a guard of honour.  Following this, External Affairs Minister  Sushma Swaraj called on the visiting dignitary.  During the meeting, Oli told Sushma Swaraj that India and Nepal have a natural and civilisational relationship, according to Swarup.  Oli's visit assumes significance as ties between the two South Asian neighbours in the last few months soured after the adoption of a new constitution in the Himalayan nation sparked violent protests in the country's southern plains.

BJP, RSS conspiring to divide Haryana on caste lines: Congress
NEW DELHI:  Congress today accused  BJP and RSS of "conspiring to divide  Haryana on caste lines", blaming it for the continued violence in the state over the  Jat stir for quota.  Party vice president  Rahul Gandhi appealed to the people to maintain peace and resolve the issue through talks.  Making a similar appeal, AICC communication department chief Randeep Surjewala appealed for "withdrawing" the agitation in the interest of the state and asked the central and the state governments to "take strong action against those inciting violence".  "I am pained to say that while the BJP and RSS are conspiring to divide the nation through communalism and regionalism, they are also engaged in an obnoxious conspiracy of dividing Haryana on caste lines.  "By making controversial and unnecessary statements everyday, the ministers, MPs and MLAs of BJP have created the current provocative situation. The BJP government has totally failed to solve it after creating the problem," Surjewala said.  Asking the BJP government in Haryana and Modi government at Centre "to refrain from divisive politics", Surjewala called for effective steps, advising the government to follow its 'rajdharma'.  "Requesting the two and half crore people of Haryana to maintain peace and brotherhood, we also appeal for complete withdrawal of the agitation in the interest of the state," Surjewala, a former Haryana minister, said.  Noting that nobody is untouched by the difficulties that have to be faced due to the agitation, he demanded that the Centre and state government resolve the matter peacefully.  The reaction by Congress came as fresh incidents of violence were today reported in Haryana as the Jat stir for quota intensified with protesters torching a railway station in Jind even as the Army conducted a flag march in two curfew-bound districts and used helicopters to reach parts of the blocked Rohtak district.

Jat stir: 'Forces dealing with dynamic situation'
CHANDIGARH: As the  Jat protests spread to more areas,  Haryana Police Chief  Yashpal Singhal today said it was taking time to bring the situation under control as the stir, which has left one dead and 78 injured, was not being spearheaded by any one particular leader.  He, however, said the situation has "improved" since yesterday and the  Army was out in the worst-hit areas to assist the police to help bring the situation under control.  Denying that there was an intelligence failure and that the government had failed to judge the situation, the  DGP told a press conference here that "The stir has now become leaderless and many youths have also jumped in, which is making our task difficult".  Singhal said, "One has to understand that the forces were dealing with a dynamic situation".  "As I said, the agitation has become leaderless. It is a widespread agitation. People are changing plans quickly, which is why it takes time to bring the situation fully under control," he said.  He said the government had first engaged some Jat and Khap leaders by having talks with them, but took appropriate steps after the situation changed.  The DGP did not agree with the view that police in  Rohtak had failed to react yesterday and it was a "free for all kind of situation".  "The situation today is better than what it was yesterday. The Army, paramilitary and police force is conducting flag march in affected areas".  "Ten columns of paramilitary forces have reached while 23 more on way and some of these will be airlifted," he said, adding that he had also spoken to the Union Home Secretary and apprised him about the ground situation.  To a question, the DGP said that one person was killed in violence in Rohtak yesterday and 78 others injured. "PGIMS Rohtak Director informed me that one person had been brought dead. In all 78 persons including five policeman were injured in the incident. 46 have been discharged from the hospital while 36 are admitted that includes 5 in the ICU," he said.  The DGP also appealed to the Khaps to suspend their meetings being held in connection with the Jat stir.  "Many youths who take part in these meetings are influenced and then they move towards major towns and cities to join other protesters. We would also appeal the village elders to make the youths understand not to join protesters and help us in bringing the situation under control," he said.  The DGP said that curfew had been imposed in Rohtak, Bhiwani and Jhajjar districts.  Giving details of the violence, he said some persons had pelted stones at the Jhajjar residence of Haryana Minister O P Dhankar, but no one was injured in the incident.  Similar incidents had also taken place as residences of  Finance Minister Capt Abhimanyu also came under attack at Rohtak while  BJP MP Raj Kumar Saini, who allegedly made anti-Jat quota remarks, was attacked by some persons at Kurukshetra.  The DGP said while most of the protesters were from Haryana, he did not rule out the possibility of "outsiders" joining the stir to create law and order problem.  "Most of the protesters are from Haryana, but we are not ruling out the possibility of those outside the state joining them," he said, adding their first priority was to bring the situation under control.  The DGP said five persons have been arrested so far in connection with the incidents of violence while 129 had been booked.  Asked to comment on fresh incidents of violence including burning down of a railway station in Jind district, violence in Meham and other places, the DGP maintained, "There was improvement in the law and order situation since yesterday..".  Asked if the state police had left the job of bringing the situation under control to Army and paramilitary forces, he said, "They are aiding us". On reports that a mob had entered the campus of MDU varsity at Rohtak, he said, "This needs to be verified".  When asked the possibility of misuse of arms and ammunition by miscreants who looted them yesterday from a shop, he said, "According to our information, the looted items mainly contained ammunition.."

Maha taskforce suggests formula to end farmers' suicides
NAGPUR: Tasked by the  Maharashtra government to study the  farm crisis in the state, Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM) has announced a two-point formula which it claims could be the key to ending  farmers' suicides in the country.  The formula is part of a report on measures needed to tackle agrarian crisis in 14 drought-prone districts of Maharashtra that Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavlamban Mission has submitted to the state government.  Kishor Tiwari, who chairs the Mission, said on Saturday the formula has two parts: a distress management relief plan and an agenda to address core isses of agrarian crisis.  The first part envisions provisions for food and health security, better farm credit facilities within the existing network, water and electricity connection to each farmer, and access to education for farmers' children, particularly in the distressed areas.  It also includes provision of more jobs under Mahatama Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and effective implementation of Mudra Scheme and other government welfare schemes by reducing corruption at various levels.  The second part addresses the core issues of agrarian crisis for which Tiwari blames the neglect and mismanagement of the officialdom.  The Mission advocates restoration of holistic and sustainable agriculture in the existing soil conditions, moisture, water availability, and suitable cropping patterns in the drought-prone areas.  Over the past six months, the Mission is advising farmers on how to slash input costs by 40 per cent by proper selection of seeds, fertilizers, etc., to avoid exploitation by traders and market players, Tiwari said.  "The  Union Budget is coming up, followed by the state budget. We call upon the state and the Centre to consider our suggestions seriously and make suitable provisions to wipe the tears off farmers' eyes," Tiwari told IANS.  With the upcoming summer season, there are reports of water shortages from different parts of the state including Marathwada and Vidarbha where the Mission is working. Another water crisis may trigger further distress among farmers.

Where Are They Now? Startup Battlefield Company PageCloud

			May9-11,2016						 |
			
				BrooklynCruiseTerminal,Brooklyn,NewYork			 
The beauty of content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, Wix, Weebly and others is in the ability to create and build a complete website using just your browser. Designers are given the flexibility to make changes to their websites using simple browser-based tools, which means they dont need to learn desktop tools like Dreamweaver or Photoshop or web programming languages like HTML and CSS.
Of course, tools like Photoshop give users a nearly unlimited ability to create, which web-based tools simply havent been able to match very well  at least until very recently. Last year, one of the Disrupt NY Startup Battlefield finalists  PageCloud  launched a web creation tool that combines the flexibility features of the CMS and their most beloved design tools in a single online, web-based platform.
PageCloud works like a CMS, runs in the cloud, and includes powerful design editing tools to help users customize and build exactly the site they want. One of PageClouds most advanced features is the drag-and-drop function, which they have taken to a completely different level. Designers can drag favorite elements from other web pages and popular editing tools right into their PageCloud designs in the browser. 
The company also reported hitting cash-flow break-even before the initial launch of itsproduct. And since their appearance at Disrupt NY, Founder and CEO Craig Fitzpatrick shared that PageCloud had completed a successful pre-order campaign, totaling just under $1.2 million USD in orders at a $99 price point.
The company launched November 30, 2015 with 12,000 paying customers in 75 countries and hasnow grown to 14,000 paying customers in 100 countries in just two months, showing revenue growth rate of 20 percent month-over-month since launch. In addition to the rapid growth, they have also made some strategic partnerships, joining forces with Getty Images and Tucows, and theyre in discussions with several other well-known companies about future partnerships. 
We are certainly looking forward to seeing whatsnextfrom this former Battlefield finalist.
And if your company is ready to make the leap, were now accepting Battlefield applications for Disrupt NY 2016.Disrupt takes place May 9-11 at the lovely Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in New York City.
If youre not quite ready, or just want to see what companies like PageCloud have in store for this years Battlefield, extra early-bird tickets to the show are also available for the deeply-discounted rate of $1,795 each, and you can visit the ticketing page for more info.

Apple Executives Detail Scope Of FBI Request And Companys Motivations For Not Complying
In a call with reporters today, Apple executives spoke in response to a motion the Justice Department filed today to force Apple to comply with a request from the FBI to provide access to the iPhone of Syed Farook taken as evidence in the case of the San Bernardino terrorist killings.
The executives  speaking on background  also explicitly stated that what the FBI is asking for  for it to create a piece of software that allows a brute force password crack to be performed  wouldalso work on newer iPhones with its Secure Enclave chip. Our previous reporting had included statements to this regard, but its worth reiterating. This is a battle Apple is fighting for all iPhones, not just older models.
Apples executives said that the methods the FBI are ordering it to use in bypassing the iPhones security could be used as a template or master key that could unlock more devices in the future. The FBIs original order and the subsequent government filings have consistently stated that the kinds of access it is looking for would be limited to this single device.
The executives said that they were speaking about these details openly now because the filing from earlier today included numerous additional pieces of information, and characterized Apples refusal to comply with the order as a marketing strategy. A previous confidentiality agreement that Apple had been under prevented them from speaking of these details, but the public brief that the DOJ filed today openly talked about these items.
The executives also reiterated that they abhor terrorism, but that have opposed the order because theycare deeply about protecting the safety of the majority of people who are not terrorists.
On the call today, a senior Apple executive said thatthey had been communicating with the government since January and had posed several different ways to get the information that the FBI says it needs. Those methods were rendered moot, said the executive, when the Apple ID passwordto the attackers account was changed less than 24 hours after the government took possession of the phone.
One such method involved utilizing a feature of iOS that connects to known WiFi networks to access the data on the device. During the attempts to leverage this method, the discovery was made that the Apple ID password had been changed while in government custody. The reset may have been performed by Farooks employer, the San Bernardino County public health department, according to the DOJ filing.

Because the Apple ID password had been changed, the iPhone could not auto backup to iCloud, providing a new backup that Apple could access to extract the information that the FBI was after.
Apple has already complied with requests for access to iCloud backups of the device, which can be accessed even though the iPhone itself is locked and encrypted with a passcode. The last backup was performed on October 19th, 2015, several weeks before the attack was carried out. It is important to note, however, that since the Apple ID password had been changed, there is no way to tell whether Farook manually disabled the iCloud backups or not. The backups were apparently sporadic, which Apple believes leftthe door openfor the possibility that they were not explicitly disabled.
The governments request hinges on the information between the October 19th date and the date of the incident. In other words, if Apple could have triggeredan iCloud backup, then it would have included the information that the FBI was after.
These methods, saidexecutives, would have made it possible to deliver the information that was requested without Apple having to modify a special version of its iPhone software to create a back door into the devices contents, bypassing the passcode. Once the password was changed, those methods became impossible.
Apple has a long history of providing data extraction servicesto government agencies, but these methods do not rely on it breaking passcodes, and only apply to iPhones running iOS 7 or previous. Since iOS 8 was released, the vast majority of information on any given iPhone is encrypted using the passcode, and unable to be accessed via extraction. This is the case with Farooks iPhone 5c.
Apple did mention that the countyagency Farook worked for installed some kind of management software on the phone, but specifics were not given. We are reaching out to the government to get characterization on what kind of device management software was installed on the iPhone and why it was not possible to use that software  common in enterprise environments like the agency that Farook worked in to reset the password.
The executives characterized the governments efforts as anything but being about a single device, pointing to the fact that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has stated that he has 175 iPhones that he would like to unlock.This has become, ladies and gentlemen, the wild west of technology, Vance said at a conference, as reported by ABC.Apple and Google are the sheriffs and there are no rules.
The Apple executive also noted that no other governmentin the world  including China  has ever asked it to perform the kind of iPhone cracking that the FBI is asking it to do. But, if it were to comply, those requests would surely not be far behind.
The executive also indicated that it was fair to anticipate that Apple would continue to harden iPhone security to protect users against this kind of cracking, whether by Apple or otherwise.

The Mobile Electorate


Nic Denholm regularly exceeds the 160-character limit for SMS marketing outfit EZ Texting.
In 2008, Barack Obama redrafted the electioneering script, becoming the first presidential candidate to use social media as a political channel. His opponents failure to grasp the significance of social media proved as catastrophic as Richard Nixons dismissive attitude to television in 1960  an attitude that probably cost him the 1960 election to the more telegenic John F. Kennedy.
That historic debate marked the beginning of a new political epoch in which mass media campaigns were the only game in town. For the next half century, presidents were made and un-made in a network television culture that was fervently centrist and uncontroversial  what Richard Wald called cementers of idea, not disruptors of idea.
Since Obama dealt the first major blow to that monolithic approach with his inaugural campaign, election campaigns have slowly returned to the grassroots  albeit of a digital variety. Presidential candidates ignore online activism and fundraising at their peril  just ask Mitt Romney, who failed to learn the lessons of 2008 just as his opponent built on them to secure a second term.
Facebook, Instagram, Twitter every online tool used by the Democrats four years ago is now in the arsenal of the current crop of candidates, but the electorate has changed the way it accesses those channels. Last year, mobile usage exceeded desktop for the first time. Not a blip  a tipping point. Now, voters are more likely to turn to their smartphones than to their TVs, laptops, PCs or print media.
According to comScore, mobile usage in 2014 accounted for 60 percent of time spent using digital media. In a presidential contest that hasnt resulted in a victory margin of more than 8.5 percent for 30 years, the huge-and-growing mobile electorate is not to be swiped left by anyone expecting to win.
The full effects of a mobile-centric campaign culture may not be felt until 2020 or later. The candidate pool is still largely comprised of super PAC-powered establishment figures, some of whom have a dynastic leg-up, to boot. But can such an apparent head start continue to be enough? Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton might give differing answers to that question. Bernie Sanders campaign, funded by small personal donations, has given Clintons more traditional big money strategy a genuine contest.
Then theres Donald Trump. Figures released in December by NBC News showed the Republican frontrunner had spent just $21,700 on broadcast advertising; the combined total TV ad spend for the three favorites (Carson, Cruz and Trump) was a tenth of the $28.9 million spent by Bush. Bushs broadcast spending has now swelled to more than $40 million. Ahead of the South Carolina Primary this weekend, Trump is currently polling at 35 percent, Bush at 8 percent.
Not that television isnt still enormously influential. Its just that Trumps campaign is the only one willing or able to dominate the media without relying on ad dollars. According to CNN, he racked up 234 minutes of network coverage between January and November of last year, compared with Bushs 56 minutes. Based on the NBC campaign spending figures from December, that equates to $94 for every minute of Trump coverage, versus $714,000 for every minute of Bush coverage. Ninety-four dollars!
To put that in perspective, Bushs spend-per-minute is roughly what it would cost to place a 60-second commercial in a primetime network slot; Trumps outlay would just about get you a black-and-white column inch in Minneapolis monthly North News.
And yet, look again at those polling figures.
With considerably less financial means at his disposal  and worlds away, politically speaking there is one thing Bernie Sanders has in common with Trump: an avowed rejection of corporate influence (excluding the Trump Organization, natch!). If you had to reduce their popular appeal down to a single issue, eschewing dark money support would probably be it. This tack would have gotten them nowhere a few election cycles ago. Now its the basis of their respective campaigns, and its working a treat.
Sanders and Trump have demonstrated that its a lot easier to live tweet your campaign travails with clean hands. Both candidates have veered so wildly off-script that mainstream media outlets cant compute or comprehend let alone compete with the messages being delivered directly to the palms of voters. That those messages have veered off in polar opposite directions makes their job twice as tough.
In what NYU Professor Jay Rosen calls the mobius strip of Trump coverage, two large, acutely structured organizational fields news media and presidential campaigns have rapidly and simultaneously had their basic assumptions discarded. If the message and the delivery system have both been switched out, where the hell does that leave the messenger?
As the electorate moves toward consuming and sharing information via niche channels, and away from engaging directly with mainstream media, candidates are following suit (its no surprise that mainstream candidates are dragging their heels while niche candidates cant quite believe their luck). Its as if the aforementioned mobile-desktop tipping point is playing out on the political landscape, with Clinton and Bush as the familiar and powerful but static PCs, and Trump and Sanders the fleet-footed, flexible but small-time smartphones.
This development doesnt feel like a blip either.
Network television is becoming a legacy platform because voters can engage with what it broadcasts via the same digital channels they use to access everything else. It doesnt work the other way round. Mainstream media gatekeepers face obsolescence because the social Web simply opens its own gates, by the thousands, every day.
This new, mobilized  and mobile-ized  electorate is a force to be reckoned with. As we head into the primaries, the sturdiness of these digital grassroots will be tested to their limit. Some of the most vocal campaigners in this race have never attended a rally, or even voted before. Theyve contributed every piece of their support  from fundraising to partisan point-scoring  via a screen. The significant change since 2012 is the size of that screen.

This five-year-old bootstrapped online fashion brand Teesort.com is aiming for a turnover of Rs 100 crore

There was a time when people from Tier II and III cities had very little access to the latest trends and fashion. In 2010, Delhi-based Atul Agarwal (33) noticed this dearth of availability and decided to fill this gap. He gave up his job to start Teesort.com the following year in 2011.
Teesort.com owns TSX.in, an online fashion apparel brand for men, based out of Delhi. It sells casual menswearboth via its own portal and through 15 online marketplaces such as Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal and HomeShop 18.
We do not get more than 20 per cent revenue from any single source or marketplace. Therefore, we are not dependant on any one source for sales and revenue, says Alok.
Teesort Team
When Teesort crossed the Rs 1 crore sales mark in 2013, Atuls brother Alok Agarwal (35) also quit his job to join Teesort. Born and brought up in Delhi, Alok is a commerce graduate from Delhi University and holds an MBA from IMT Ghaziabad. Before joining Teesort, Alok had worked with Vodafone, Bharti Teletech and MTS in multiple capacities.Atul is a BITS Pilani graduate in Computer Science & Engineering. He has workedwithTCS in France before joining Teesort.
The journey to achieving the Rs 1 crore was not a smooth one. One of their biggest challenges was gaining the customers confidence in buying apparel online. At the time, customers were still wary of sharing their bank credentials and were not sure if they would get what they had paid for.
Alok Agarwal, Co-founder, Teesort.com
Processing orders
Apart from buying readymade casual menswearonline, Teesort also allows customers to choose and print their favourite designs on T-shirts, jackets, track pants, and more. Currently, it works with more than 16 manufacturers across India. With 13 logistics partners, it delivers orders within 72 hours. Alok says that 10-12 per cent of their total revenue goes towards their logistics partners. They receive 3,000 orders on an average per day. On average, price points range from Rs. 350 -2,000.
We have proprietary software, which helps us forecast the kind of inventory we require. Once we give the manufacturers our requirement, they manufacture clothes, test them and then it reaches our warehouse for sale. The products fit is designed according to available customer data analysis. At the same time, we have multiple designs in the same pattern available across all pin codes, says Atul.
Atul Agarwal, Co-founder, Teesort.com
Teesort has so far delivered more than 2 million orders. Nearly 70 to 75 per cent of its business comes from Tier II and III cities, mostly from North and South India.
Growth trajectory
Teesort was started with a seed capital of Rs 50 lakhs (from friends and family) which has been used in its initial three years of operation. Till now, the growth of the company has been funded by its own gross margin of 40 per cent.
Currently, based out of Delhi, Teesort is planning to expand its footprint in Bengaluru and open a warehouse there in the next five to six months. The company has 40 employees and is likely to make an aggressive marketing push to promote its TSX brand in smaller cities across India. Going forward, the company will focus more on digital and print advertising in both national and regional publications. It has allocated Rs 10 crore for marketing initiatives for the next financial year.
Teesort.com is growing at a rate of 300 per cent year on year and is planning to cross the sales number from Rs. 100 crores to Rs. 500 crores in the next two to three years. It will expand the portfolio to two new categories  womenswear and kidswear, and is looking to establish its presence in the Middle East and South East Asia.
A glimpse of the apparel e-retail market 
According to a report by Google, Indias fashion e-retail market is expected to touch $35 billion by 2020, and it is likely to constitute 35 per cent of the total online retail revenue. With marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, Flipkart and Snapdeal adding more and more sellers and improving delivery efficiency, buying fashionable and designer apparel is just one click away.
Apart from the big players like Yepme, Zovi and Jabong, startups like Fashionara, Bewakoof, Fashion and You, Koovs and Fashionove are striving to meet the demand and supply gap in both metros and small towns and cities. With the evolution of e-commerce, today people from Tier II and III cities have access to all the latest collections.
Other portals offering customised T-shirts include Socratees, customique, iLogo.in, 99tshirts.com, Campus Sutra and more. With the growing accessibility of the online apparel market, manufacturers and designers are flourishing across India.
Moreover, investors also seem to be very bullish on this markets growth prospects. Gurgaon based fashion e-retailer Yepme raised $75 million from Malaysian state fund Khazanah Nasional Berhad. Zovi has raised $50 million to launch its Little app. Jabong has also raised $200 million.
However,Teesort being bootstrapped has achieved a revenue of Rs. 30 crores in the last fiscal year and is expecting to achieve a revenue of Rs. 100 crores in this fiscal year.
We are perhaps the only bootstrapped yet profitable online private fashion brand! says Atul.

How this father built Affimity, an interest-based networking platform, out of Palo Alto and Bengaluru

Networking has become an important catchphrase. Social networks now are moving from people connectivity to interest and group connectivity. Joining this bandwagon is Palo Alto and Benglauru-based Affimity. This mobile platform helps people with similar interests connect and have meaningful conversations.
Most of todays social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest are centred on people you friend or follow. You are connected to all of their thoughts regardless of your interest, resulting in a lot of noise from your perspective, says 44-year-old Parveen Mittal, Co-founder and CEO Affimity.
To ensure that they bring in the relevant connections, the team reached out to niche segments like food bloggers, upcoming book authors, music cover artists, and others. The idea of starting Affimity came to Venkata Ramana, when he faced the interesting dilemma of being an older parent of toddle twins. Most of his friends had kids in school and their discussions revolved around other parenting milestones.
Team @ Affimity
Finding relevant sources of conversation starters
Being the odd one out, Venkata was in the lookout for a community that would empathise with him. While on some level the different Facebook groups did that, the overall experience wasnt as satisfactory and he felt that the privacy rules were confusing. In conversation with friends, Venkata realised that there isnt a real platform available that brings together people sharing specific interests. Be it parenting, sports, or technology.
Venkata believed that this gap could be sealed by simply attending to user interests first; rather than their acquaintances. He had worked with Amar J. Singh and Parveen earlier and continued to be in touch. While Venkata had his own pain-point, the other two realised that they had limited options of networking.
The idea of building an alternative social platform appealed to the trio and they decided to start Affimity. Venkata, IIT Chennai and Stanford alumnus, is out of the Bay Area and is a successful technologist and entrepreneur. He previously co-founded Stratify, a Data Discovery company.
Parveen, IIT Bombay and IIM-A alumnus, is based out of Bengaluru and was leading HPs Big Data R&D team in India before joining Affimity. Amar is based in the Bay Area and has proven experience in managing large scale IT operations.
Not yet another social networking site
Parveen adds that Affimity doesnt want to just replicate your physical social network online, but helps you reinvent and expand your social circle based on your interest. He adds they as the team understand that people may be passionate about one or more things in life and those things may change over time. Affimitys channel-based social network helps you follow your passion without worrying about privacy or what your extended family might say, adds Parveen.
While enabling better connections, content, and communities for its users, Affimity can better discern the true breadth of their interests and depth of their passions. Since the user interacts with content and people in specific interest channels, Affimity understands the context of that interaction better than monolithic networks that have to deal with inherently weak signals.
Base and future
Within six months of their launch, the team claims to have few hundred thousands of app downloads. The website brings in just about 10 per cent of total user engagement.
Parveen states that 50 per cent of their user base is from India and the USA, with the rest from all corners of the globe. More importantly, we are seeing a steep increase in user interaction, with many more posts, comments, and friends requests, adds Parveen.
Affimity is built on an open-source technology stack and is hosted on AWS. It also provides a platform on which any number of channels can be created. Users can subscribe to one or more channels. They can share their thoughts, ask questions or just browse, make friends or follow people. Unlike other social networks, Affimity does not associate a user with his real-life friends but enables him to discover like-minded people.
The team secured $1.2 million of angel funding from Silicon Valley angel investors. They will be using this funding to expand their services in India and other parts of the globe.
Affimity plans to be the platform of choice for anyone looking to share his interests with others. Their immediate plan is to provide better content and community experience as they intend to reach out to more people. Parveen says they are continuously adding channels as well as customising each of them to suit the requirement of that particular community.
The networking space
Over the past few years, the number of social networking sites and interest social networking platforms have increased. Some of these include Smartican, Brigge, and Gurgaon-based DIKY. All of these platforms were formed with the idea of helping connect like-minded people and not just friends and family.
If you look at the growth of the social networking sites, by the end of 2012, there were close to 1.6 billion individuals regularly using social networking sites across the globe. By end of 2013, this number touched 1.8 billion marking 70 per cent of the Internet users and by 2017 this number will be 2.5 billion.

Umberto Eco has died

The Italian writer and philosopher Umberto Eco, best known for his novel The Name of the Rose, has died aged 84.
His family says he passed away late on Friday at his home. No further details were given. 
The Name of the Rose was made into a film in 1989 starring Scottish actor Sean Connery.
Eco, who also wrote the novel Foucault's Pendulum, continued to publish new works, with Numero Zero released last year.
He also wrote children's books and literary criticism.  
Eco once wrote that "books always speak of other books, and every story tells a story that has already been told".
"I am a philosopher," he was quoted as saying. "I write novels only on the weekends."
Eco founded the communications department at the University of San Marino in the 1980s. 
He was later professor emeritus and chairman of the Higher School of Humanities of the University of Bologna.
Eco was born in Alessandria, northern Italy, in 1932.

The Joy and Agony of Haskell in Production
There have been several good talks about using Haskell in industry lately, and several people asked me to write about my personal experiences. Although I cant give specific details I will speak broadly about some things Ive learned and experienced.
The myths are true. Haskell code tends to be much more reliable, performant, easy to refactor, and easier to incorporate with coworkers code without too much thinking. Its also just enjoyable to write.
The myths are sometimes trueisms. Haskell code tends to be of high quality by construction, but for several reasons that are only correlated; not causally linked to the technical merits of Haskell. Just by virtue of language being esoteric and having a relatively higher barrier to entry well end up working with developers who would write above average code in any language. That said, the language actively encourage thoughtful consideration of abstractions and a brutal (as John Carmack noted) level of discipline that high quality code in other languages would require, but are enforced in Haskell.
Prefer to import libraries as qualified. Typically this is just considered good practice for business logic libraries, it makes it easier to locate the source of symbol definitions. The only point of ambiguity Ive seen is disagreement amongst developers on which core libraries are common enough to import unqualified and how to handle symbols. This ranges the full spectrum from fully qualifying everything (Control.Monad.>>=) to common things like (Data.Maybe.maybe) or just disambiguating names like (Map.lookup).
Consider rolling an internal prelude. As weve all learned the hard way, the Prelude is not your friend. The consensus historically has favored the Small Prelude Assumption which presupposes that tools get pushed out into third party modules, even the core tools that are necessary to do anything (text, bytestring, vector, etc). This makes life easier for library authors at the cost of some struggle for downstream users.
In practice any non-trivial business logic module can very easily have 100+ lines just of imports, and frankly it gets tiring. One common way of abstracting this is by rolling a custom prelude using module reexports. Consider a minimal use case like the following:
This can be put into a cabal package which transitively pulls in the core dependencies and then is used in our downstream module.
There are several custom preludes that are available on Hackage in the Prelude category.
Haskell has world class libraries. There is an abundance of riches on Hackage in libraries like quickcheck, mtl, pipes, conduit, tasty, attoparsec, sbv and many more. Knowing where to start with the ecosystem can be a little tricky, and there are sometimes multiple competing solutions. A conservative start to a library might consist of something like the following build-depends in our cabal file:
For many problem domains the libraries simply arent written yet. There are many domains that Haskell is used in, for tasks as diverse as trading systems, spam filtering, to web services. Chances are there are a plethora of libraries available some tasks. Yet it goes without saying that Haskell is not Java or Python and there simply isnt an equivalent mindshare for certain tasks. If we need to connect to Microsoft SQL Server or a SOAP service, were probably going to have more trouble. The primitives are probably there to do it, but often there is no off-the-shelf solution.
Usually it boils down to: If you dont write that library, no one else will.
There isnt a global concensus on how to write Haskell. Being an abnormally expressive languages means Haskell is written in such wildly different styles to the point of being almost a different language in some cases. There are wildly different views on how to structure large applications and not a whole lot is written about best practices for doing so. Most of the schools of thought differ about how far along the spectrum we should strive for correctness and what power-to-weight ratio is appropriate for certain tasks.
Its hard to give universal advice about how to structure Haskell logic that applies to all problems, and Id be skeptical of anyone who did. For a certain set of tasks that are command line utilities, processing pipelines, or web services its certainly possible to write applications that dont involve monad transformers but there are certainly many other domain where the natural choice is to roll a tree-like structure of monad transformer objects that encapsulate common logic like Error and State.
If we look at the history of programming, there are many portents of the future of Haskell in the C++ community, another language where no two developers (that Ive met) agree on which subset of the language to use.
Configuration For configuration Bryans configurator library is invaluable. The library specifies an external configuration flat file which can hold credentials, connections and cluster topology information. A typical pattern is to embed this in a ReaderT and then asks for any field necessary in downstream logic.
The configuration file might look like the following:
Haskell is full of distractions. There are plenty of distractions that will lead us down the wrong path or distract us from our core business. Working in industry means that ultimately our job is create software that drives the creation of revenue, not necessarily to advance the state of art. Although the two are not necessarily mutually incompatible.
With this in mind, its important to note there are plenty of vocal Haskellers who work under a value system that is largely incompatible with industrial practices. Much of which stems from hobbyists or academics who use Haskell as a vehicle for their work. Not to diminish this category people or their work, yet the metrics for success in this space are different enough that they tend to view the programming space from a perspective that can be incommensurable to industrial programmers.
The tensions of academic and industrial influences in Haskell is one of the strong driving forces for progress; but it also leads to conflicts of interest for many of us who write code to support ourselves. If one decides to engage with the community, its important to realize that many of the topics being actively discussed are likely 3+ years out from being at the point where one would want to bet the livelihood of a company on.
Testing and building. For development builds using cabal sandboxes its usually essential to be able to pull in internal libraries that are not on Hackage. To do with cabal sandboxes this can be achieved with either a script to provision the dependencies.
With stack this can actually all be configured in the stack.yaml file.
Private TravisCI or Codeship are not worth the trouble of setting up if one ever envisions the project spanning multiple repos. Getting their virtual machine provisioned with the proper credentials to pull from multiple Github repos is still a source of trouble. For build slaves and continuous integration Ive used BuildBot successfully to work with the usual cabal and stack toolchain.
For large multi-package builds, I cant speak highly enough of Neil Mitchells build system shake which is itself written in Haskell. The shake build uses Shakefiles which are monadic description of a graph of dependencies to resolve and their artifacts. For a contrived example consider running a Markdown file through Pandoc.
Fast builds lead to faster turnaround. If care isnt taken, projects can quickly devolve to become unmanageably slow to compile, usually the problem is avoidable with some care. Deriving instances of Read/Show/Data/Generic for largely recursive ADTs can sometimes lead to quadratic memory behavior when the nesting gets deep. The somewhat ugly hack to speed up compile time here is to run ghc -ddump-deriv Module.hs and then manually insert the resulting code instead of deriving it everytime. Not a great solution, but Ive seen it drastically improve compilation footprint and time. Also be tactical with uses of INLINE and SPECIALIZE as inlining at many call sites has a non-trivial cost. Avoid TemplateHaskell as it can cause ridiculously inflated build times and enormous memory footprints in GHCi.
Its pretty common to use ghci and ghcid to during development stage. Your mileage may also vary with ghc-mod support for Vim and Emacs which allows in-editor type introspection.
Pulling from cabal to provision our test server can take minutes to hours depending on the size of our dependency tree. Fortunately its easy to set up a Hackage server mirror that contains all of our internal dependencies that can be served quickly from our local servers or an S3 bucket. We can then simply alter our ~/.cabal/config to change the remote-repo to our custom mirror.
Records The record system is a continual source of pain. Its best to come up with an internal convention for naming record accessors and use qualified imports. It sucks for now, but there are some changes coming up the 8.0 release that will make life easier.
When using Generics to derive ToJSON and FromJSON instances there is fieldLabelModifier field that can be used to modify the derived field so the serialize does not have to match the Haskell record accessors. For example well drop the first three characters:
This will serialize out to.
Performance and Monitoring A common performance problem is that of many small updates updates to records with large numbers of fields. Records of hundreds of fields are somewhat pathological but in practice they show up in a lot of business logic that needs to interact with large database rows. Too much of this can very noticeable impact on GC pressure by doing allocations on each update. If you notice runaway memory performance, one of the first places to look (after the usual suspects) is look for overgrown records and possibly inside of StateT with use of lots of modify`` in sequence.
The other very common library for live performance monitoring is ekg which simply forks off a thread that manages the state of the GHC runtime internals and can serve this data to other logging services via HTTP + JSON or via a web server. For example:
ekg has several large dependencies so sometimes its desirable to optionally enable it with a cabal configuration flag so that its not included unless we want a development build. We just qualify our build-depends to include it in the dependencies if the flag is set via cabal configure -fekg.
Strings The strings types are mature, but unwieldy to work with in practice. Its best to just make peace with the fact that in literally every module well have boilerplate just to do simple manipulation and IO. OverloadedStrings overcomes some of the issues, but its still annoying that youll end up playing string type-tetris a lot.
If you end up rolling a custom prelude its worth just correcting putStrLn and print to what they should be in a just world:
A common pattern is to use a multiparamter typeclass to do string conversions between all the common (Data.Text.Text, Data.Text.Lazy, Data.ByteString.UTF8 Data.ByteString.Lazy.UTF8, [Char]) types. Youll end up eating at least one typeclass dictionary lookup per call to s but this is fairly benign in most cases.
There are libraries on hackage ( string-convert, string-conv ) that implement this pattern.
Documentation is abysmal. Open source Haskell libraries are typically released with below average or non-existent documentation. The reasons for this are complicated confluence of technical and social phenomena that cant really be traced back to one root cause. Basically, its complicated. What this means for industrial use is to always budget extra hours of lost productivity needed to reverse engineering libraries from their test suites just to get an minimal example running. Its not great, but thats the state of things.
You own the transitive dependency tree. With such a small ecosystem, anything we pull in you have to be able to maintain and support should the upstream source dry up or wither on the vine. The cold truth is if theres no community-provided documentation for the library and you depend on it for your product, youve just added technical debt to your company. The person you have to hand the code off to will have to read through your code and all its transitive dependencies, and while the undocumented upstream libs might make sense they may utterly confound your predecessor.
If youre depending on your Haskell code being stable and supportable its worth being conservative in what dependencies you pull into your tree.
Avoid TemplateHaskell. Enough said, its a eternal source of pain and sorrow that I never want to see anywhere near code that I had to maintain professionally. The best quote about this is found in this StackOverlow thread:
Think about it. Half the appeal of Haskell is that its high-level design allows you to avoid huge amounts of useless boilerplate code that you have to write in other languages. If you need compile-time code generation, youre basically saying that either your language or your application design has failed you.
If you need to crank out that much boilerplate just to get something done, go back and rethink. If a upstream library forces you to use it, dont depend on that library. There is almost always a way to accomplish the task without falling back on TH.
Dont be afraid to train people. Contrary to a lot of popular myths, with the right direction people can indeed pick up Haskell quite quickly. There are great developers outside the community who given a little bit of insight into Haskell will turn into great Haskellers. People who have a little experience with Scheme, Clojure, Scala, Ocaml can pretty quickly learn the language.
I was fortunate enough to train an a very talented intern named Dan who came in not knowing any Haskell (was primarily a Java developer) and in two weeks had picked up the language and was amazingly productive. Learning on your own is much more time consuming than having a Haskell friend sitting next to you. Its a time investment, but it can pay off exponentially with the right person and with Dan it most certainly did.
Network with other industrial users. There is no shortage of hobbyist Haskell programmers to consult with about problems. Though by my estimates in the United States there are probably only around 70-100 people working on Haskell fulltime and a good deal more working part-time or anticipating using it. Its worth networking with other industrial users to share best practices.
Eventually with enough use, many of these rough corners in the language will get polished over, best practices become absorbed, and libraries will get built.

A bot has successfully appealed $3M worth of parking tickets in the UK
Flickr/Charleston's The Digitel

Hiring a lawyer for a parking-ticket appeal is not only a headache, but it can alsocost more than the ticket itself.Depending on the case and the lawyer, an appeal  a legal processwhere you argue out of paying the fine  can cost between $400 to $900.
But with the help of a robot made by British programmer Joshua Browder, 19,it costs nothing. Browder's bothandles questions about parking-ticket appeals in the UK.Since launching in late 2015, ithas successfully appealed $3 million worth of tickets.
Joshua BrowderJoshua Browder's robot can help answer questions about parking tickets.

Once you sign in, a chat screen pops up. To learnabout your case, the bot asks questions like "Were you the one driving?" and "Was it hard to understand the parking signs?" It thenspits out an appeal letter, which youmail to the court.If the robot is completely confused, it tells youhow to contact Browder directly.
The site is still in beta, and the full version will launch this spring, Browder, a Stanford University freshman,tells Tech Insider.
Since laws are publicly available, bots can automate some of the simple tasks that human lawyers have had to do for centuries.Browder'sisn't even the first lawyer bot. The startup Acadmx'sbot creates perfectly formatted legal briefs.The company Lex Machinadoes data mining on judges' records and makes predictions on what they will do in the future.
Beyond parking tickets, Browder's botcan also help with delayed or canceled flights and payment-protection insurance (PPI) claims.Although the bot can only help file claims on simple legal issues  it can't physically argue a case in front of a judge  it can save users a lot of money.
Browderprogrammed hisrobot based on a conversation algorithm. It uses keywords, pronouns, and word order to understand the user's issue.He says that the more people use the robot, the more intelligent it becomes.Its algorithmcanquicklyanalyze large amounts of data while improving itself in the process.
AlthoughBrowder programmed the bot accordingto UK law, he says it can be helpful in the US, too. For example, if a flight is delayed from New York City to London, the ticket holdercan use the robot to claim compensation.Browder is working to program US city laws intothe bot, starting with New York.
While Browderdoesn't think robots will be debating in the US Supreme Court anytime soon, he believes that, as artificial intelligence technology progresses,fewer lawyers will do mundane tasks.
"As a 19-year-old, I have coded the entirety of the robot on my own, and I think it does a reasonable job of replacing parking lawyers," he says. "I know there are thousands of programmers with decades more experience than me working on similar issues."
Kevin LamarqueUS Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer.

But are bots like these the same as hiring a lawyer?
It depends on whether theycross the ethical line of giving subjective advice, says Bradley Moss,a DCattorney who specializes in national security. If the bot were to answer subjective questions, then that would be viewed as practicing law, which only humans can legally do.
Moss says (emphasis added):
There are ethical and legal limits to what they can do.Programs such as this one do not, at least in my humble opinion, threaten the legal profession writ large.They will, however, continue to streamline processes for handling simple tasks that arguably people should be able to handle without the need for  and expense of  formal legal assistance.
MGM Studios"Legally Blonde's" beloved yet fictitious lawyer, Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon).

Most of these bots are tools that can rapidly crawl public records and serve up legal information. Bots can't provide full and genuine legal counsel, and it will likely take them several decades to become as sophisticated as humans, says Samuel Woolley, who tracks and studies political bots.
"Bots can'tfully replace human actors  not in the foreseeable future, at least," he tells Tech Insider. "They can'tprovide nuanced social insight because they can't really understand humor or emotional subtleties."
When driverless cars start dominating the roadsin the future, theymay alsoautomatically appeal speeding tickets. Browder isalready talking with entrepreneurs about integrating his bot into cars.
He'sprogrammingthe bot to handle more complicated legal issues, too, including asylum for Syrian refugees. The language barrier is a coding challenge,since the robot needsto understand Arabic but produce a legal document in English. This bot will likely launchby summer  at no cost.
"If it is one day possible for any citizen to get the same standard of legal representation as a billionaire,"Browder says, "how can that not be a good thing?"

TensorFuse  Common Interface for Theano / TensorFlow / CGT
Common interface for Theano, CGT, TensorFlow, and mxnet.
The recommended way to install this library is python setup.py develop.
The current API for TensorFuse is geared towards migrating existing Theano-based code to using CGT, TensorFlow, or mxnet. Therefore, if you have some code that uses Theano, you can simply change the import statements to
Then (hopefully) your code can switch between Theano / CGT / TensorFlow easily. The choice is controlled by an environment variable TENSORFUSE_MODE, with valid values theano, cgt, mxnet, tensorflow, or tf for abbreviation (if no environment variable is set, then it defaults to Theano). Therefore, to run the code in TensorFlow mode, you can either set the environment variable before running the script, or add the following to the beginning of the file:
To run the code in CGT mode, do the following:

GitHub lock-in?
written on Friday, February 19, 2016
There has been a lot of noise recently on how GitHub is bad, and how developers should stop using it.
Most of GitHub is proprietary. That is true, but GitHub is, in my opinion, an "ethical" proprietary software company, if such thing can exist:
They have been running an open-core based, sustainable business model from day 1: you get most features for free, you pay for some of them (private repositories, self-hosted instances...). They do not rely on ads, or on selling your personal information to some creepy entities, or on bundling malware into binary installers (SourceForge used to do that, nice to see the new owners are getting rid of that abomination)
They produce and contribute to free software: they created Jekyll, they work on Git itself, they sponsor Git conferences...
They won market share by providing great services, not (as far as I know) by using rogue techniques to eliminate competitors.
I read time and time again that migrating from GitHub is difficult. But how much of this difficulty comes from GitHub itself?
So yes, all your data is accessible, as long as you are willing to do the work. A migration is a lot of work. You will have to:
It's hard, but the fact that GitHub is proprietary does not make it harder to migrate away from it. It would be just as much work to migrate from a free-software powered project host.
There is therefore no vendor lock-in, it's just that like any migration, it takes time and dedication to do it right.
A competitor willing to make it easy for GitHub project maintainers to migrate to their services could actually make use of GitHub APIs and provide an automated migration system.
Note: I wrote "your data is accessible", but actually I should rather write "your data is currently accessible". Theoretically, nothing prevents GitHub from removing programmatic access to parts of the data they host. That is the greatest danger of not self-hosting your data, and it's true for any hosting platform, even if its software is free: it does not help that the software is free if someone unplugs the servers or hides them behind a paywall. If the data hosted on GitHub (or on any external service) is critical for you, then you'd better setup periodic scripts to backup everything. This way the minute your host goes bad and removes access to your data, you can switch to another service or start hosting your own.
The second obstacle preventing projects from migrating away from GitHub is user convenience. Developers prefer hosting their projects on GitHub for similar reasons Internet shops open a merchant account on Amazon: potential customers are already there, and they are used to its UI. It is sad though that for many developers leaving the comfort zone of GitHub is not an option, if you want to be a good developer, I consider it a prerequisite to always be willing to learn. If learning how to operate on another code host is too challenging, well, what can I say...
Think I am exaggerating? Read the comments on the ESLint issue where they discuss migrating away from GitHub, some of them are disheartening:
As a fairly nascent developer, I think one of the things that I / people with my experience level care about is establishing credibility / getting credit for open source contributions, and whether we like it or not, github has become the first place to look whenever someone is trying to judge someone's contributions. It shows contribution activity loud and clear on profile pages, and this type of attribution is really helpful / important for new contributors to prove their mettle in the open source world. I feel that not having this kind of attribution would not provide enough motivation / demoralize a lot of people who would want to contribute, and I think this kind of lack of motivation and enthusiasm can be to the detriment of the project in the long term.
Given those considetations, I would really hate to see this project leave Github.
I am not going to pretend I never used my contributions to free software to land jobs. But it would never come to my mind to have the arrogance of requesting that a project stays hosted on a particular service because it would make it harder for me to show off if they moved away! Is it not possible to put links in a resume anymore?
People are also wary of GitHub because of the increased monoculture which results from it having no perceived direct competitors. Again, GitHub has not removed any option from people, they won market share by providing great services people enjoyed using. When/if a competitor gains more traction by providing better services we might see a more diverse project hosting ecosystem. I am looking forward to this, because I think monoculture is indeed dangerous, and a bit more competition on this domain can only benefit us developers. But the ball is in the competitors' hands.
It's not like the field is empty though: there are already plenty of alternative hosting solutions available: GitLab, BitBucket, Google is building something, maybe even SourceForge will become less creepy now that it has a new owner. Large free-software communities also often offer hosting projects: the KDE sysadmins do awesome work on KDE infrastructure, GNOME, Debian and others can host your projects as well... Wikipedia has a nice list of source code hosting facilities.
Alternatively, there are plenty of existing solutions to host your own repositories if you are willing to go this way. If you want a full-blown alternative, I heard GitLab is great. Gitolite is nice for simpler needs. You can also just push bare repositories to a remote server accessible over SSH (my solution for personal needs).
I believe GitHub is not the problem: there are plenty of alternatives to host your projects if GitHub services do not match your criteria for your new project. GitHub does not actively prevent you from moving away from them if you are willing to do so. You just have to walk the walk.

A Technical Perspective on the Apple iPhone Case
The legal dispute between Apple and the FBI might prove pivotal in the long-running battle to protect users' privacy and right to use uncompromised encryption. The case has captured the public imagination. Of course, EFF supports Apple's efforts to protect its users.
The case is complicated technically, and there is a lot of misinformation and speculation. This post will offer a technical overview, based on information gleaned from the FBI'scourt motionand Apple's security documentation.
Apple is being asked to assist the FBI's ongoing investigation of last December's San Bernardino mass shooting by providing software to unlock a phone used by (deceased) suspectSyed Rizwan Farook (though owned by his employer, the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health). Legally, the FBI is citing the All Writs Act, a general-purpose law first enacted in 1789 that can allow a court to require third parties assistance to execute a prior order of the court when "necessary or appropriate." Judges have questioned the application of this general purpose law for unlocking phones.
Farook's phone is an iPhone 5c, a model sold in late 2013 and early 2014. This model supports disk encryption, meaning straightforward forensic techniques to examine the phone's storage cannot be used by themselves (i.e. physically removing the memory device to examine it directly). The data on disk cannot be decrypted without knowing the correct cryptographic key. This key is generated by combining the user's passcode with a key baked in to the hardware in a way that is designed to be difficult to extract. The only intended way to access the phone's memory is through the phone itself, using the correct passcode.
In this case, the FBI is requesting that Apple create and digitally sign a special version of iOS which is modified in three ways, as specified on page 8 of the court order:
The FBI has told the court that its goal is to guess Farook's passcode to unlock his phone. If it just tries entering passcodes, though, it might erase the device's keys, at which point the data may never be recoverable. Hence, it wants Apple to write special "cracking software" to ensure that can't happen, and to make the passcode-guessing process easier and faster.
This is technically possible, although it would be a considerable amount of work for the FBI to reverse-engineer all of the details of Apple's encryption format. However, iPhones are designed to only run software which is digitally signed by Apple. Digital signatures are a cryptographic process requiring a secret signing key. In the case of iPhones, this signing key is known only by Apple. So even if the FBI wrote its own software, the phone wouldn't run it unless it were signed by Apple.
Despite some claims to the contrary, no. The court document claims that Apple is in the business of writing software so they must have the ability to produce this cracking software. However, writing any secure software is hard,especially so for low-level operating system software that interacts closely with hardware. Apple would also want to apply rigorous testing to any code it is signing. This is a little bit like asking General Motors to build a new truck with a fifth wheel by next month. Of course they could theoretically do this with enough effort. They're in the business of building cars. But it would be expensive and time-consuming for them to be sure the new car is safe.
The bottom line is, implementing any new security feature is not trivial and should not be treated as such. Apple is right to resist being asked to modify the security-critical portions of its software at the government's request.Building backdoors has been a security nightmarein the past.
From a technical standpoint, it would be possible to craft the cracking software to only run on Farook's phone by checking its hardware ID. The court order was actually quite specific that this is all that is being requested. Many commentators have claimed that binding to a specific phone is "easy", but again, writing secure software is never easy. For example, it might not be simple for the cracking software to determine for certain which phone it is running on. In this case, one risk would be that the software attempts to only run on Farook's phone, but there's a way to modify other phones to fool the cracking software into running on them as well, turning a device-specific key into a master key.
As Apple wrote to its customers "while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control." The government is telling Apple to try to limit the scope of the cracking software, but this is a burden Apple would reasonably like to avoid.
The answer any trained security engineer will give you is "it shouldn't be." It's important to realize that if Apple's iOS signing key were ever leaked, or used to sign a malicious piece of code, it would undermine the secure boot loading sequence of the entire iOS platform. Apple has worked very hard to try to limit its devices to run only Apple-signed firmware and OS code. There are pros and cons to this approach, but Apple considers this signing key among the crown jewels of the entire company. There is no good revocation strategy if this key is leaked, since its corresponding verification key is hard-coded into hundreds of millions of devices around the world.
While we don't know what internal security measures Apple takes with its signing key, we should hope they are very strict. Apple would not want to store it on Internet-connected computers, nor allow a small group of employees to abscond with it or to secretly use the key on their own. It is most likely stored in a secure hardware module in a physical vault (or possibly split across several vaults) and requires several high-level Apple personnel to unlock the key and sign a new code release. A rough comparison showing the complexity that is involved in making high-assurance digital signatures is the DNSSEC Root KSK signing ceremony process(for which video is available online). This is a complicated procedure involving dozens of people.
Whatever Apple's process is, it's not something they want to undertake frequently. This enables a deliberately slow and costly security process. If the government begins routinely demanding new phone-specific cracking software, this could overwhelm the security of this process by requiring many more signatures. This is another valid reason why Apple is right to fight this order.
It would get easier. Much of the cost and difficulty of implementing this cracking software would not need to be repeated in the next case. Assuming Apple developed a working version, it would simply be a matter of changing which phone ID the software was bound to and re-signing it. However, the difficulty of signing code would need to be repeated every time. And as Apple releases new devices, this code would need updating and maintenance (though as pointed out below, it will be less effective on newer phones).
Practically, writing this code would probably encourage more government requests (potentially from other governments around the world). Furthermore, in the US, once this code exists, it could be argued that the burden of complying with requests will become lower. This could have legal impact because of courts' interpretation of the All Writs Act's "necessary or appropriate" limitation to require that assistance not be "unduly burdensome."
It's impossible to rule this out. There are many potential avenues for a security compromise in Apple's secure boot-loading process that could be used to evade passcode rate-limiting. Indeed, the hobbyist community has worked on ways to "jailbreak" iPhones for years which enables them to run unsigned code. The FBI could also attempt to physically extract the encryption keys from the hardware, something government agencies have studied how to do in other contexts, though this is a messy process with some risk of destroying the keys before they can be read.
So it's possible there are other ways. This point is potentially relevant legally, as cases interpreting the All Writs Act require "an absence of alternative remedies." However, we lack firm evidence that the FBI has such a capability. Apple also probably doesn't want to argue that its phone is insecure so the authorities should just break into it some other way.
It might seem the FBI wouldn't go through such a public battle if they had a secret way to get the data, but even if they did it's likely they wanted to take this case to court because the high-profile nature of the San Bernardino shootings makes this a sympathetic case to create a legal precedent in their favor.
It's been stated that Apple has unlocked phones 70 times in the past for the authorities. However, this was a very different proposition for older phones without disk encryption. For older phones with no encryption, Apple already had a software version to bypass the unlock screen (used, for example, in Apple stores to unlock phones when customers had forgotten their passcode). So this past history might be completely irrelevant for the case at hand if it's a difference between writing new security-critical software and using software that already existed. In this case, Apple is not refusing to do something that it has done before; the kind of assistance it provided in the past would not be relevant here.
Furthermore, even if Apple had written custom-cracking software in the past, it might reasonably no longer want to do so due to the security risks of writing, testing, and signing this software listed above.
Maybe, but we don't know for sure how much. It appears from Apple's security whitepaper that the iPhone's encryption uses an iterated key-derivation function which is designed to require the phone to take a minimum of 80 ms to check a passcode guess, regardless of what software is running. This calculation is designed to be inherently complex and slow to complete. Apple says that passcode strength affects how long a guessing attack would take; for long passcodes, that delay, by itself, might be long enough delay to make guessing infeasible even with special cracking software. For example, if the passcode contained eight random lowercase letters, it would take about 700 years to guess at this rate.
Since late 2014, all iPhones ship with a "secure enclave," a cryptographic coprocessor which stores keys in tamper-resistant hardware. The secure enclave imposes much longer timeouts of its own on passcode guessing attempts; after nine incorrect attempts, it permits only one guess per hour, a further 45,000 times slower than the delay mentioned above. (Older devices that lack the secure enclave also apply a similar delay, but apparently do so from within the operating system.) It's possible, though not completely clear from Apple's documentation, that a software update would be able to modify this behavior; if not, this would completely prevent Apple from enabling faster passcode guessing on newer devices.
There has been further speculation that the secure enclave could refuse to accept any software update (even one signed by Apple) unless unlocked by entering the passcode, or alternately, that a software update on a locked phone would erase all of the cryptographic keys, effectively making the phone's storage unreadable. Apple's security documentation makes no such guarantees, though, and there are indications that this isn't the case. So special cracking tools from Apple could potentially still modify the secure enclave's behavior to remove both the 10-guess limit and the delays between guesses.
It's important to realize though that even if today's secure enclave doesn't erase the device after a software update while the device is locked, this could be changed in future devices. It's possible someday Apple or another company will ship devices with secure hardware controlling the device encryption keys that cannot be overridden even by signed software. In that future world, there really would be no way for Apple to assist in an investigation like this.
EFF supports Apple's stand against creating special software to crack their own devices. As the FBI's motion concedes, the All Writs Act requires that the technical assistance requested not be "unduly burdensome," but as outlined above creating this software would indeed be burdensome, risky, and go against modern security engineering practices.

Resume Reading  Why Our Intuition About Sea-Level Rise Is Wrong
Jerry Mitrovica has been overturning accepted wisdom for decades. A solid Earth geophysicist at Harvard, he studies the internal structure and processes of the Earth, which has implications for fields from climatology to the timing of human migration and even to the search for life on other planets. Early in his career he and colleagues showed that Earths tectonic plates not only move from side to side, creating continental drift, but also up and down. By refocusing attention from the horizontal of modern Earth science to the vertical, he helped to found what he has nicknamed postmodern geophysics. Recently Mitrovica has revived and reinvigorated longstanding insights into factors that cause huge geographic variation in sea level, with important implications for the study of climate change today on glaciers and ice sheets.
We caught up with Mitrovica in his airy office next to Harvards renowned mineral collection. Though a practiced public speaker and recipient of numerous awards, in person he speaks softly and deflects plaudits. He refers frequently to the colleagues, graduate students, and mentors who have inspired him and contributed to his work.
Some of your recent research follows from the attraction of ocean water to ice sheets.That seems surprising.
This is just Newtons law of gravitation applied to the Earth. An ice sheet, like the sun and the moon, produces a gravitational attraction on the surrounding water. Theres no doubt about that.
What happens when a big glacier like the Greenland Ice Sheet melts?
Three things happen. One is that youre dumping all of this melt water into the ocean. So the mass of the entire ocean would definitely be going up if ice sheets were meltingas they are today. The second thing that happens is that this gravitational attraction that the ice sheet exerts on the surrounding water diminishes. As a consequence, water migrates away from the ice sheet. The third thing is, as the ice sheet melts, the land underneath the ice sheet pops up; it rebounds.
So what is the combined impact of the ice-sheet melt, water flow, and diminished gravity?
Gravity has a very strong effect. So what happens when an ice sheet melts is sea level falls in the vicinity of the melting ice sheet. That is counterintuitive. The question is, how far from the ice sheet do you have to go before the effects of diminished gravity and uplifting crust are small enough that you start to raise sea level? Thats also counterintuitive. Its 2,000 kilometers away from the ice sheet. So if the Greenland ice sheet were to catastrophically collapse tomorrow, the sea level in Iceland, Newfoundland, Sweden, Norwayall within this 2,000 kilometer radius of the Greenland ice sheetwould fall. It might have a 30 to 50 meter drop at the shore of Greenland. But the farther you get away from Greenland, the greater the price you pay. If the Greenland ice sheet melts, sea level in most of the Southern Hemisphere will increase about 30 percent more than the global average. So this is no small effect. 
The last time we were as warm as we are today, the ice sheets that we think of as the least stable disappeared.
What happens with melting in Antarctica?
If the Antarctic ice sheets melt, sea level falls close to Antarctic. But it would rise more than youd otherwise expect in the Northern Hemisphere. These are known as sea-level fingerprints, because each ice sheet has its own geometry. Greenland produces one geometry of sea level change and the Antarctic has its own. Mountain glaciers have their own fingerprint. This explains a lot of variability in sea level. Its also a really important opportunity. If you have people denying climate change because they say theres geographic variation in sea level changesit doesnt go up uniformlyyou can say, Well, that is incorrect because ice sheets produce a geographically variable change in sea level when they melt. You can also use that variability to say this percentage is coming from Greenland, this percentage is coming from the Antarctic, and this percentage is coming from mountain glaciers. You can source the melt. And thats an important argument from a public-hazard viewpoint.
Why is the source of the melt important?
If youre living on the U.S. east coast, or Holland, you dont need to worry what global average sea-level rise is doing. I was in Holland a few summers ago and was trying to convince the Dutch that if the Greenland ice sheet melts, they have less to worry about than the Antarctic ice sheet melting. But it doesnt register. When I give public talks, people just shake their heads. They dont believe it when I show this bulls-eye around the melting [Greenland] ice sheet, which is an area where sea level will fall. Our intuition is built from walking along a shoreline or turning a tap on. It isnt from considering what would happen if a major large-scale ice sheet melts.
Why are you so confident that the worlds glaciers, including the polar ice sheets, will keep melting?
One way to understand where were heading in this warming world of ours is to run a climate model. The other way is to look to the past and ask what the ice sheets did the last time we were this warm or a little bit warmer. Were currently in an interglaciala warm period between glacial cycles. If humans werent warming the climate, Earth might be poised to enter into another Ice Age in the future. The last interglacial prior to the present one was about 120,000 years ago. Of course, 120,000 years ago, humans werent having any impact on climate. That was natural climatic variability.
What did the ice sheets do the last time the climate was this warm?
The last time we were as warm as we are today, the ice sheets that we think of as the least stable disappeared, albeit over a protracted period. So why should we expect that the issue is going to be any different in the next few hundreds to thousands of years? Theres no reason to believe it, unless we do something to reverse what were doing.
OK. So wed expect warming to cause ice sheets to melt and raise sea level. But whats the evidence that were seeing that now?
The average sea level change in the 20th century was 1.2 millimeters per year. What weve seen in the last 20 years is an average of three millimeters per yearthats a factor of two-and-a-half increase from the 20th century to now. So thats a nice way to address the skeptics argument that it hasnt changed or that its not getting worse. Its already gotten worse. And if you look back thousands of years, you have a wide range of tools at your disposal. One is eclipse records, and one is the Roman fish tanks.
What do Roman fish tanks tell us about sea levels?
Wealthy Romans at the time of Augustus were building fish holding tanks. The fishermen would come in with the fish, theyd put them there so that the fish were fresh when they ate themthey wanted to keep them alive for a few days or weeks or whatever. The Romans were engineers, so they built these fish tanks at very precise levels relative to sea level at the time. You didnt want the walls to be too low because at high tide the fish would swim out; you didnt want it to be too high because you wanted tides to refresh the water within the tanks.
Kurt Lambeck, a professor at the Australian National University, recognized that by looking at the present day elevation of those fish tanks, we could say something about how sea level had changed over the 2,500 years since then. If sea level over the last 2,500 years was going up at the rate that it went up in the 20th century, those fish tanks would be under 4 meters of water12 feet of waterand I can assure you theyre not. You can see them. You can walk along the coast, theyre visible. What that tells you is that it is impossible that sea level went up by the rates that we saw in the 20th century for any extended period of time earlier than that. Sea level has not gone up over the last 2,500 years like it has in the 20th century.
This is an entirely different way to show that ice sheets are melting.
What can records of Babylonian eclipses 2,500 years ago tell us about climate change?
When we look at eclipse records, we can say heres when a Babylonian eclipse was recorded. Now, I can do a calculation and ask when that Babylonian eclipse should have occurred if the present rotation rate of the Earth had stayed constant in the time between the eclipse and present day. And you can do that for Greek, Arabic, Babylonian, Chinese eclipses, and this is what a professor in the U.K., F. Richard Stephenson, did. He tabulated, as others did before him, a large suite of such eclipses that show a clear slowing of the Earths rotation rate over the last few thousand years. Say you have two clocks synchronized 2,500 years ago. One kept time perfectly and the other was connected to the Earth whose rotation rate was slowing. Over 2,500 years, they would go out of sync by about four hours. Thats kind of the level of slowing. So what we know is that the Earths rotation rate has slowed over the last 2,500 years. But the Earths slowing isnt what we would predict exactly.
Why would you expect the Earths rotation to slow at all?
I just published this paper in Science Advances on something called Munks Enigma. What we showed is that it comes from three different effects. One is whats known as tidal dissipation. Tides crash into the shoreline and each time they do they dissipate energy, and for a variety of reasons they slow the Earths rotation. Another thing we talk about is that there is a very subtle coupling between the core of the Earth, which is iron, and the rocky part of the Earth, the mantle, which acts to change the Earths rotation rate we see sitting on the surface of the planet.
Is it like the friction of the fluid in a cars a transmission; it has to do with how viscous the connection is between the inner and outer parts of the planet?
Its not friction, but its pretty darn close. Its the fact that youve got one fluid moving against another fluid thats moving at a different rate. If they come out of sync, their rates will influence each other. But it is as you say, a connection.
So, this is another effect. We have the tides crashing in and what geophysicists would call core-mantle coupling. We can predict both of those pretty accurately, but youre still left with a difference and that difference is due to the ice age and we model that. Weve got tidal dissipation, core-mantle coupling, and now we add the Ice Age Effect, which Im the expert on. And lo and behold, when I add that to these other two effects, I get precisely the four-hour slowing I saw.
What is the Ice Age Effect?
The Earth is growing more spherical because 20,000 years ago we had a lot more ice at the poles. When ice sheets were at the poles they kind of squished the Earth from both poles and the Earth flattened a little bit. When those ice sheets melted, that flattening started to rebound and were becoming spherical, so our spin rate should be increasing, like a ballerina or a figure skater. The ice age correction is a speeding up of the rotation rate.
So these three factorscore-mantle coupling, post ice rebounding of poles, and tidal dissipationexplain changes in the speed of the Earth until the 20th century. Whats happening now?
We want to take that same ice age model and correct for 20th-century changes in Earths rotation. When we do, we get a difference that we havent explained yet. So now we say; well, maybe thats due to polar ice sheet melting or polar glacier melting.
The way to do that is to go to the IPCC, their last assessment report, and look at the calculation of mountain glacier melting, because those tabulations suggest that the ice sheets werent changing that much in the 20th century. Ice sheets have only really started to melt in the last 20 years or so, but the glaciers were popping off all through the 20th century. We take that glacier melting that the IPCC tells us, compute its effect on rotation, and one effect would be to slow the Earths rotation just like the figure skater, and compare it to these ice-age corrected observations.
Is water moving off glaciers, slowing the Earths rotation, this time analogous to a figure skater putting arms out?
Right. Glaciers are mostly near the axis. Theyre near the North and South Poles and the bulk of the ocean is not. In other words, youre taking glaciers from high latitudes like Alaska and Patagonia, youre melting them, they distribute around the globe, but in general, thats like a mass flux toward the equator because youre taking material from the poles and youre moving it into the oceans. That tends to move material closer to the equator than it once was.
So the melting mountain glaciers and polar caps are moving bulk toward the equator?
Yes. Of course, there is ocean everywhere, but if youre moving the ice from a high latitude and youre sticking it over oceans, in effect, youre adding to mass in the equator and youre taking mass away from the polar areas and thats going to slow the earth down. Thats the calculation we did. We also computed how those glaciers would affect the orientation of poles. In both cases, when you do that calculation and you compare it to this ice age corrected satellite and astronomical observations, you fit them precisely.
What we showed in this recent paper is that when you look at the modern data on rotation and you correct for ice age, you have a leftover, and that leftover is precisely what it should be if it were due to the kind of melting that global change scientists believe happened in the 20th century.
There are some things that you can explain, but as a scientist youre always going to face things that are counterintuitive.
With all those steps, its amazing that the calculations work out.
This is an entirely different way to show that ice sheets are melting. Its a very good way because if youre looking at Greenland and you say, Oh, its melting in the southern sector, I can see ice diminishing, you dont necessarily know what its doing in the northern sector. You dont get a good integrated view of what the Greenland ice sheet is doing. But rotation doesnt care about north vs. south, it just cares about how much mass is moving from Greenland into the oceans. And so rotation provides what a scientist would call a really elegant integrated measure of the mass balance of polar ice sheets.
What inspired you to become a scientist?
In my family, we had more discussions about Renaissance history than we ever did about science. Im the only scientist in my family. I went into whats called an engineering science or engineering physics program. I took a course in plate tectonics in my third year, and I thought, Whoa! And my first paperit wasnt my idea, it was my advisors ideaabout what caused the flooding of the western part of North America 50 to 80 million years agothat was quite a thrill. Youre a few years into research graduate school, and youve just published a paper that explains why North America was underwater, the western part.
What is the explanation?
Some said it was some ice effect, that ice volumes had changed. More often people thought that it was linked to changes in the rate at which tectonic plates were created. But in my work and that of some colleagues weve shown that those sorts of events when continents flood typically are due not to some global change in sea level. Rather, its due to the vertical motion of the continent itself reacting to the flow thats driving plate tectonics and driving continents up and down.
So many of your results seem abstract and counterintuitive. Is that a coincidence?
There are so many interesting problems in our science that you can see with your eyes. But your eyes can fool you. Richard Feynman, the great physicist, used to start his physics lectures by showing students their intuition could take them a long way. They could do things just through intuition that would get them roughly the right answer. Then he used to throw some counterintuitive examples at them. Then he said, This is why you need physics. You need to understand when your intuition might go wrong. I firmly am a Feynman acolyte. There are some things that you can explain, but as a scientist youre always going to face things that are counterintuitive. Youre never going to understand that water is falling near an ice sheet from your everyday experiences of the bathtub. You need to bring in something more; in this case, Newtons second law of gravitation. You have to bring in physics; otherwise, youre never going to explain that.
Where do your A-ha! moments come from?
I think some scientists would disagree with me, but I think you really do have to give yourself time to think. You need to have some way in your life as a scientist to mull over what youre seeing. And I strongly encourage my graduate students to have other interests, because the best way to have that time is to take a break from science. Ive had moments where Ive seen something in my models that Id never seen before and I think, Well, you know, a good scientist is never going to walk away from that. A good scientist at that point sort of burrows in and says, Why am I seeing that? Because to see the unexpected is the reward of science.

What sparked the Cambrian explosion?

Nature
|
News Feature

An evolutionary burst 540 million years ago filled the seas with an astonishing diversity of animals. The trigger behind that revolution is finally coming into focus.
John Sibbick/Natural History Museum
The Cambrian seas teemed with new types of animal, such as the predator Anomalocaris (centre).
A series of dark, craggy pinnacles rises 80 metres above the grassy plains of Namibia. The peaks call to mind something ancient  the burial mounds of past civilizations or the tips of vast pyramids buried by the ages.
Earliest skeletal animals were reef builders
The stone formations are indeed monuments of a faded empire, but not from anything hewn by human hands. They are pinnacle reefs, built by cyanobacteria on the shallow sea floor 543 million years ago, during a time known as the Ediacaran period. The ancient world occupied by these reefs was truly alien. The oceans held so little oxygen that modern fish would quickly founder and die there. A gooey mat of microbes covered the sea floor at the time, and on that blanket lived a variety of enigmatic animals whose bodies resembled thin, quilted pillows. Most were stationary, but a few meandered blindly over the slime, grazing on the microbes. Animal life at this point was simple, and there were no predators. But an evolutionary storm would soon upend this quiet world.
Within several million years, this simple ecosystem would disappear, and give way to a world ruled by highly mobile animals that sported modern anatomical features. The Cambrian explosion, as it is called, produced arthropods with legs and compound eyes, worms with feathery gills and swift predators that could crush prey in tooth-rimmed jaws. Biologists have argued for decades over what ignited this evolutionary burst. Some think that a steep rise in oxygen sparked the change, whereas others say that it sprang from the development of some key evolutionary innovation, such as vision. The precise cause has remained elusive, in part because so little is known about the physical and chemical environment at that time.
But over the past several years, discoveries have begun to yield some tantalizing clues about the end of the Ediacaran. Evidence gathered from the Namibian reefs and other sites suggests that earlier theories were overly simplistic  that the Cambrian explosion actually emerged out of a complex interplay between small environmental changes that triggered major evolutionary developments.
Ancient fossils sport modern brains
Some scientists now think that a small, perhaps temporary, increase in oxygen suddenly crossed an ecological threshold, enabling the emergence of predators. The rise of carnivory would have set off an evolutionary arms race that led to the burst of complex body types and behaviours that fill the oceans today. This is the most significant event in Earth evolution, says Guy Narbonne, a palaeobiologist at Queen's University in Kingston, Canada. The advent of pervasive carnivory, made possible by oxygenation, is likely to have been a major trigger.
In the modern world, it's easy to forget that complex animals are relative newcomers to Earth. Since life first emerged more than 3 billion years ago, single-celled organisms have dominated the planet for most of its history. Thriving in environments that lacked oxygen, they relied on compounds such as carbon dioxide, sulfur-containing molecules or iron minerals that act as oxidizing agents to break down food. Much of Earth's microbial biosphere still survives on these anaerobic pathways.
Animals, however, depend on oxygen  a much richer way to make a living. The process of metabolizing food in the presence of oxygen releases much more energy than most anaerobic pathways. Animals rely on this potent, controlled combustion to drive such energy-hungry innovations as muscles, nervous systems and the tools of defence and carnivory  mineralized shells, exoskeletons and teeth.
Oxygen fluctuations stalled life on Earth
Given the importance of oxygen for animals, researchers suspected that a sudden increase in the gas to near-modern levels in the ocean could have spurred the Cambrian explosion. To test that idea, they have studied ancient ocean sediments laid down during the Ediacaran and Cambrian periods, which together ran from about 635 million to 485 million years ago.
In Namibia, China and other spots around the world, researchers have collected rocks that were once ancient seabeds, and analysed the amounts of iron, molybdenum and other metals in them. The metals' solubility depends strongly on the amount of oxygen present, so the amount and type of those metals in ancient sedimentary rocks reflect how much oxygen was in the water long ago, when the sediments formed.
These proxies seemed to indicate that oxygen concentrations in the oceans rose in several steps, approaching today's sea-surface concentrations at the start of the Cambrian, around 541 million years ago  just before more-modern animals suddenly appeared and diversified. This supported the idea of oxygen as a key trigger for the evolutionary explosion.
But last year, a major study1 of ancient sea-floor sediments challenged that view. Erik Sperling, a palaeontologist at Stanford University in California, compiled a database of 4,700 iron measurements taken from rocks around the world, spanning the Ediacaran and Cambrian periods. He and his colleagues did not find a statistically significant increase in the proportion of oxic to anoxic water at the boundary between the Ediacaran and the Cambrian.
Archaeageddon: how gas-belching microbes could have caused mass extinction
Any oxygenation event must have been far, far smaller than what people normally considered, concludes Sperling. Most people assume that the oxygenation event essentially raised oxygen to essentially modern-day levels. And that probably wasn't the case, he says.
The latest results come at a time when scientists are already reconsidering what was happening to ocean oxygen levels during this crucial period. Donald Canfield, a geobiologist at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, doubts that oxygen was a limiting factor for early animals. In a study published last month2, he and his colleagues suggest that oxygen levels were already high enough to support simple animals, such as sponges, hundreds of millions of years before they actually appeared. Cambrian animals would have needed more oxygen than early sponges, concedes Canfield. But you don't need an increase in oxygen across the Ediacaran/Cambrian boundary, he says; oxygen could already have been abundant enough for a long, long time before.
The role of oxygen in the origins of animals has been heavily debated, says Timothy Lyons, a geobiologist at the University of California, Riverside. In fact, it's never been more debated than it is now. Lyons sees a role for oxygen in evolutionary changes, but his own work3 with molybdenum and other trace metals suggests that the increases in oxygen just before the Cambrian were mostly temporary peaks that lasted a few million years and gradually stepped upward (see 'When life sped up').

Sperling has looked for insights into Ediacaran oceans by studying oxygen-depleted regions in modern seas around the globe. He suggests that biologists have conventionally taken the wrong approach to thinking about how oxygen shaped animal evolution. By pooling and analysing previously published data with some of his own, he found that tiny worms survive in areas of the sea floor where oxygen levels are incredibly low  less than 0.5% of average global sea-surface concentrations. Food webs in these oxygen-poor environments are simple, and the animals feed directly on microbes. In places where sea-floor oxygen levels are a bit higher  about 0.53% of concentrations at the sea surface  animals are more abundant but their food webs remain limited: the animals still feed on microbes rather than on each other. But around somewhere between 3% and 10% oxygen levels, predators emerge and start to consume other animals4.
Does evolutionary theory need a rethink?
The implications of this finding for evolution are profound, Sperling says.The modest oxygen rise that he thinks may have occurred just before the Cambrian would have been enough to trigger a big change. If oxygen levels were 3% and they rose past that 10% threshold, that would have had a huge influence on early animal evolution, he says. There's just so much in animal ecology, lifestyle and body size that seems to change so dramatically through those levels.
The gradual emergence of predators, driven by a small rise in oxygen, would have meant trouble for Ediacaran animals that lacked obvious defences. You're looking at soft-bodied, mostly immobile forms that probably lived their lives by absorbing nutrients through their skin, says Narbonne.
Studies of those ancient Namibian reefs suggest that animals were indeed starting to fall prey to predators by the end of the Ediacaran. When palaeobiologist Rachel Wood from the University of Edinburgh, UK, examined the rock formations, she found spots where a primitive animal called Cloudina had taken over parts of the microbial reef. Rather than spreading out over the ocean floor, these cone-shaped creatures lived in crowded colonies, which hid their vulnerable body parts from predators  an ecological dynamic that occurs in modern reefs5.
Cloudina were among the earliest animals known to have grown hard, mineralized exoskeletons. But they were not alone. Two other types of animal in those reefs also had mineralized parts, which suggests that multiple, unrelated groups evolved skeletal shells around the same time. Skeletons are quite costly to produce, says Wood. It's very difficult to come up with a reason other than defence for why an animal should bother to create a skeleton for itself. Wood thinks that the skeletons provided protection against newly evolved predators. Some Cloudina fossils from that period even have holes in their sides, which scientists interpret as the marks of attackers that bore into the creatures' shells6.
Palaeontologists have found other hints that animals had begun to eat each other by the late Ediacaran. In Namibia, Australia and Newfoundland in Canada, some sea-floor sediments have preserved an unusual type of tunnel made by an unknown, wormlike creature7. Called Treptichnus burrows, these warrens branch again and again, as if a predator just below the microbial mat had systematically probed for prey animals on top. The Treptichnus burrows resemble those of modern priapulid, or 'penis', worms  voracious predators that hunt in a remarkably similar way on modern sea floors8.
The rise of predation at this time put large, sedentary Ediacaran animals at a big disadvantage. Sitting around doing nothing becomes a liability, says Narbonne.
The moment of transition from the Ediacaran to the Cambrian world is recorded in a series of stone outcrops rounded by ancient glaciers on the south edge of Newfoundland. Below that boundary are impressions left by quilted Ediacaran animals, the last such fossils recorded on Earth. And just 1.2 metres above them, the grey siltstone holds trails of scratch marks, thought to have been made by animals with exoskeletons, walking on jointed legs  the earliest evidence of arthropods in Earth's history.
No one knows how much time passed in that intervening rock  maybe as little as a few centuries or millennia, says Narbonne. But during that short span, the soft-bodied, stationary Ediacaran fauna suddenly disappeared, driven to extinction by predators, he suggests.
This is the most significant event in Earth evolution.
Narbonne has closely studied the few fauna that survived this transition, and his findings suggest that some of them had acquired new, more complex types of behaviour. The best clues come from traces left by peaceful, wormlike animals that grazed on the microbial mat. Early trails from about 555 million years ago meander and criss-cross haphazardly, indicating a poorly developed nervous system that was unable to sense or react to other grazers nearby  let alone predators. But at the end of the Ediacaran and into the early Cambrian, the trails become more sophisticated: creatures carved tighter turns and ploughed closely spaced, parallel lines through the sediments. In some cases, a curvy feeding trail abruptly transitions into a straight line, which Narbonne interprets as potential evidence of the grazer evading a predator9.
This change in grazing style may have contributed to the fragmentation of the microbial mat, which began early in the Cambrian. And the transformation of the sea floor, says Narbonne, may have been the most profound change in the history of life on Earth10, 11. The mat had previously covered the seabed like a coating of plastic wrap, leaving the underlying sediments largely anoxic and off limits to animals. Because animals could not burrow deeply in the Ediacaran, he says, the mat meant that life was two-dimensional. When grazing capabilities improved, animals penetrated the mat and made the sediments habitable for the first time, which opened up a 3D world.
Tracks from the early Cambrian show that animals started to burrow several centimetres into the sediments beneath the mat, which provided access to previously untapped nutrients  as well as a refuge from predators. It's also possible that animals went in the opposite direction. Sperling says that the need to avoid predators (and pursue prey) may have driven animals into the water column above the seabed, where enhanced oxygen levels enabled them to expend energy through swimming.
The emerging evidence about oxygen thresholds and ecology could also shed light on another major evolutionary question: when did animals originate? The first undisputed fossils of animals appear only 580 million years ago, but genetic evidence indicates that basic animal groups originated as far back as 700 million to 800 million years ago. According to Lyons, the solution may be that oxygen levels rose to perhaps 2% or 3% of modern levels around 800 million years ago. These concentrations could have sustained small, simple animals, just as they do today in the ocean's oxygen-poor zones. But animals with large bodies could not have evolved until oxygen levels climbed higher in the Ediacaran.
Understanding how oxygen influenced the appearance of complex animals will require scientists to tease more-subtle clues out of the rocks. We've been challenging people working on fossils to tie their fossils more closely to our oxygen proxies, says Lyons. It will mean deciphering what oxygen levels were in different ancient environments, and connecting those values with the kinds of traits exhibited by the animal fossils found in the same locations.
This past autumn, Woods visited Siberia with that goal in mind. She collected fossils of Cloudina and another skeletonized animal, Suvorovella, from the waning days of the Ediacaran. Those sites gave her the chance to gather fossils from many different depths in the ancient ocean, from the more oxygen-rich surface waters to deeper zones. Wood plans to look for patterns in where animals were growing tougher skeletons, whether they were under attack by predators and whether any of this had a clear link with oxygen levels, she says. Only then can you pick out the story.

A Skeleton Key of Unknown Strength (CVE-2015-7547)
TL;DR: The glibc DNS bug (CVE-2015-7547) is unusually bad. Even Shellshock and Heartbleed tended to affect things we knew were on the network and knew we had to defend. This affects a universally used library (glibc) at a universally used protocol (DNS). Generic tools that we didnt even know had network surface (sudo) are thus exposed, as is software written in programming languages designed explicitly to be safe. Who can exploit this vulnerability? We know unambiguously that an attacker directly on our networks can take over many systems running Linux. What we are unsure of is whether an attacker anywhere on the Internet is similarly empowered, given only the trivial capacity to cause our systems to look up addresses inside their malicious domains.
Weve investigated the DNS lookup path, which requires the glibc exploit to survive traversing one of the millions of DNS caches dotted across the Internet. Weve found that it is neither trivial to squeeze the glibc flaw through common name servers, nor is it trivial to prove such a feat is impossible. The vast majority of potentially affected systems require this attack path to function, and we just dont know yet if it can. Our belief is that were likely to end up with attacks that work sometimes, and were probably going to end up hardening DNS caches against them with intent rather than accident. Were likely not going to apply network level DNS length limits because that breaks things in catastrophic and hard to predict ways.
This is a very important bug to patch, and it is good we have some opportunity to do so.
Its problematic that, a decade after the last DNS flaw that took a decade to fix, we have another one. Its time we discover and deploy architectural mitigations for these sorts of flaws with more assurance than technologies like ASLR can provide. The hard truth is that if this code was written in JavaScript, it wouldnt have been vulnerable. We can do better than that. We need to develop and fund the infrastructure, both technical and organizational, that defends and maintains the foundations of the global economy.
Click here if youre a DNS expert and dont need to be told how DNS works.
Click here if your interests are around security policy implications and not the specific technical flaw in question.
=====
Here is a galaxy map of the Internet. I helped the Opte project create this particular one.

And this galaxy is Linux  specifically, Ubuntu Linux, in a map by Thomi Richards, showing how each piece of software inside of it depends on each other piece.

There is a black hole at the center of this particular galaxy  the GNU C Standard Library, or glibc. And at this center, in this black hole, there is a flaw. More than your average or even extraordinary flaw, its affecting a shocking amount of code. How shocking?

Ive seen a lot of vulnerabilities, but not too many that create remote code execution in sudo. When DNS aint happy, aint nobody happy. Just how much trouble are we in?
Were not quite sure.
Most Internet software is built on top of Linux, and most Internet protocols are built on top of DNS. Recently, Redhat Linux and Google discovered some fairly serious flaws in the GNU C Library, used by Linux to (among many other things) connect to DNS to resolve names (like google.com) to IP addresses (like 8.8.8.8). The buggy code has been around for quite some time  since May 2008  so its really worked its way across the globe. Full remote code execution has been demonstrated by Google, despitethe usual battery of post-exploitation mitigations like ASLR, NX, and so on.
What we know unambiguously is that an attacker who can monitor DNS traffic between most (but not all) Linux clients, and a Domain Name Server, can achieve remote code execution independent of how well those clients are otherwise implemented. (Android is not affected.) That is a solid critical vulnerability by any normal standard.
Ranking exploits is silly. Theyre not sports teams. But generally, what you can do is actually less important than who you have to be to do it. Bugs like Heartbleed, Shellshock, and even the recent Java Deserialization flaws ask very little of attackers  they have to be somewhere on a network that can reach their victims, maybe just anywhere on the Internet at large. By contrast, the unambiguous victims of glibc generally require their attackers to be close by.
Youre just going to have to believe me when I say thats less of a constraint than youd think, for many classes of attacker youd actually worry about. More importantly though, the scale of software exposed to glibc is unusually substantial. For example:

Thats JavaScript, Python, Java, and even Haskell blowing right up. Just because theyre memory-safe doesnt mean their runtime libraries are, and glibc is the big one under Linux they all depend on. (Not that other C libraries should be presumed safe. Ahem.)
Theres a reason Im saying this bug exposes Linux in general to risk. Even your paranoid solutions leak DNS  you can route everything over a VPN, but youve still got to discover where youre routing it to, and thats usually done with DNS. You can push everything over HTTPS, but whats that text after the https://? Its a DNS domain.
Importantly, the whole point of entire sets of defenses is that theres an attacker on the network path. That guy just got a whole new set of toys, against a whole new set of devices. Everyone protects apache, who protects sudo?
So, independent of whatever else may be found, Florian, Fermin, Kevin, and everyone else at Redhat and Google did some tremendous work finding and repairing something genuinely nasty. Patch this bug with extreme prejudice. Youll have to reboot everything, even if it doesnt get worse.
It might get worse.
DNS is how this Internet (there were several previous attempts) achieves cross-organizational interoperability. It is literally the identity layer everything else builds upon; everybody can discover Googles mail server, but only Google can change it. Only they have the delegated ownership rights for gmail.com and google.com. Those rights were delegated by Verisign, who owns .com, who themselves received that exclusive delegation from ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.
The point is not to debate the particular trust model of DNS. The point is to recognize that its not just Google who can register domains; attackers can literally register badguy.com and host whatever they want there. If a DNS vulnerability could work through the DNS hierarchy, we would be in a whole new class of trouble, because it is just extraordinarily easy to compel code that does not trust you to retrieve arbitrary domains from anywhere in the DNS. You connect to a web server, it wants to put your domain in its logs, its going to look you up. You connect to a mail server, it wants to see if youre a spammer, its going to look you up. You send someone an email, they reply. How does their email find you? Their systems are going to look you up.
It would be unfortunate if those lookups led to code execution.
Once, I gave a talk to two hundred software developers. I asked them, how many of you depend on DNS? Two hands go up. I then asked, how many of you expect a string of text like google.com to end up causing a connection to Google? 198 more hands. Strings containing domain names happen all over the place in software, in all sorts of otherwise safe programming languages. Far more often than not, those strings not only find their way to a DNS client, but specifically to the code embedded in the operating system (the one thing that knows where the local Domain Name Server is!).  If that embedded code, glibc, can end up receiving from the local infrastructure traffic similar enough to what a full-on local attacker would deliver, were in a lot more trouble. Many more attackers can cause lookups to badguy.com, than might find themselves already on the network path to a target.
Glibc is what is known as a stub resolver. It asks a question, it gets an answer, somebody else actually does most of the work running around the Internet bouncing through ICANN to Verisign to Google. These somebody elses are Domain Name Servers, also known as caching resolvers. DNS is an old protocol  it dates back to 1983  and comes from a world where bandwidth was so constrained that every bit mattered, even during protocol design. (DNS got 16 bits in a place so TCP could get 32. We were young, we needed the bits was actually a thing.) These caching resolvers actually enforce a significant amount of rules upon what may or may not flow through the DNS. The proof of concept delivered by Google essentially delivers garbage bytes. Thats fine on the LAN, where theres nothing getting in the way. But name servers can essentially be modeled as scrubbing firewalls  in most (never all) environments, traffic that is not protocol compliant is just not going to reach stubs like glibc. Certainly that Google Proof of Concept isnt surviving any real world cache.
Does that mean nothing will? As of yet, we dont actually know. According to Redhat:
A back of the envelope analysis shows that it should be possible to write correctly formed DNS responses with attacker controlled payloads that will penetrate a DNS cache hierarchy and therefore allow attackers to exploit machines behind such caches.
Im just going to state outright: Nobody has gotten this glibc flaw to work through caches yet. So we just dont know if thats possible. Actual exploit chains are subject to what I call the MacGyver effect. For those unfamiliar, MacGyver was a 1980s television show that showed a very creative tinkerer building bombs and other such things with tools like chocolate. The show inspired an entire generation of engineers, but did not lead to a significant number of lost limbs because there was always something non-obvious and missing that ultimately prevented anything from working. Exploit chains at this layer are just a lot more fragile than, say, corrupted memory. But we still go ahead and actually build working memory corruption exploits, because some things are just extraordinarily expensive to fix, and so we better be sure theres unambiguously a problem here.
At the extreme end, there are discussions happening about widespread DNS filters across the Internet  certainly in front of sensitive networks. Redhat et al did some great work here, but we do need more than the back of the envelope. Ive personally been investigating cache traversal variants of this attack. Heres what I can report after a day.
Somewhat simplified, the attacks depend on:.
The flaw is linkedtothe fact that the stack has two outstanding requests at the same time  one for IPv4 addresses, and one for IPv6 addresses. Furthermore DNS can operate over both UDP and TCP, with the ability to upgrade from the former to the latter. There is error handling in DNS, but most errors and retries are handled by the caching resolver, not the stub. That means any weird errors just cause the (safer, more properly written) middlebox to handle the complexity, reducing degrees of freedom for hitting glibc.
Given that rough summary of the constraints, heres what I can report. This CVE is easily the most difficult to scope bug Ive ever worked on, despite it being in a domain I am intimately familiar with. The trivial defenses against cache traversal are easily bypassable; the obvious attacks that would generate cache traversal are trivially defeated. What we are left with is a morass of maybes, with the consequences being remarkably dire (even my bug did not yield direct code execution). Heres what I can say at present time, with thanks to those who have been very generous with their advice behind the scenes.
Where I think were going to end up, around 24 (straight) hours of research in, is that some networks are going to be vulnerable to some cache traversal attacks sometimes, following the general rule of attacks only get better. That rule usually only applies to crypto vulns, but on this half-design half-implementation vuln, we get it here too. This is in contrast to the on-path attackers, who just need to figure out how to smash a 2016 stack and away they go. Theres a couple comments Id like to make, which summarize down to This may not get nasty in days to weeks, but months to years has me worried.
Lets talk about suggested mitigations, and then go into what we can learn policy-wise from this situation.
No other way to say it. Redhat might as well have suggested filtering all AAAA (IPv6) records  might actually be effective, as it happens, but it turns out security is not the only engineering requirement at play. DNS has had to engineer several mechanisms for sending more than 512 bytes, and not because it was a fun thing to do on a Saturday night. JavaScript is not the only thing thats gotten bigger over the years; we are putting more and more in there and not just DNSSEC signatures either. What is worth noting is that IT, and even IT Security, has actually learned the very very hard way not to apply traditional firewalling approaches to DNS. Basically, as a foundational protocol its very far away from normal debugging interfaces. That means, when something goes wrong  like, somebody applied a length limit to DNS traffic who was not themselves a DNS engineer  theres this sudden outage that nobody can trace for some absurd amount of time. By the time the problem gets tracedwell, if you ever wondered why DNS doesnt get filtered, that is why.
And ultimately, any DNS packet filter is a poor version of what you really want, which is an actual protocol enforcing scrubbing firewall, i.e. a name server that is not a stub, though it might be a forwarder (meaning it enforces all the rules and provides a cache, but doesnt wander around the Internet resolving names). My expectations for mitigations, particularly as we actually start getting some real intelligence around cache traversing glibc attacks, are:
Local resolvers are popular anyway, because they mean theres a DNS cache improving performance. A large number of embedded routers are already safe against the verified on-path attack scenario due to their use of dnsmasq, a common forwarding cache.
Note that technologies like DNSSEC are mostly orthogonal to this threat; the attacker can just send us signed responses that he in particular wants to break us. I say mostly because one mode of DNSSEC deployment involves the use of a local validating resolver; such resolvers are also DNS caches that insulate glibc from the outside world.
There is the interesting question of how to scan and detect nodes on your network with vulnerable versions of glibc. Ive been worried for a while were only going to end up fixing the sorts of bugs that are aggressively trivial to detect, independent of their actual impact to our risk profiles. Short of actually intercepting traffic and injecting exploits Im not sure what we can do here. Certainly one can look for simultaneous A and AAAA requests with identical source ports and no EDNS0, but thats going to stay that way even post patch. Detecting what on our networks still needs to get patched (especially when ultimately this sort of platform failure infests the smallest of devices) is certain to become a priority  even if we end up making it easier for attackers to detect our faults as well.
If youre looking for actual exploit attempts, dont just look for large DNS packets. UDP attackswill actually be fragmented (normal IP packets cannot carry 2048 bytes) and you might forgetDNS can be carried over TCP. And again, large DNS replies are not necessarily malicious.
And thus, we end up at a good transition point to discuss security policy. What do we learn from this situation?
Patch this bug. Youll have to reboot your servers. It will be somewhat disruptive. Patch this bug now, before the cache traversing attacks are discovered, because even the on-path attacks are concerning enough. Patch. And if patching is not a thing you know how to do, automatic patching needs to be something you demand from the infrastructure you deploy on your network. If it might not be safe in six months, why are you paying for it today?
Its important to realize that while this bug was just discovered, its not actually new. CVE-2015-7547has been around for eight years. Literally, six weeks before I unveiled my own grand fix to DNS (July 2008), this catastrophic code was committed.
Nobody noticed.
The timing is a bit troublesome,but lets be realistic: theres only so many months to go around. The real issue is it took almost a decade to fix this new issue, right after it took a decade to fix my old one (DJB didnt quite identify the bug, but he absolutely called the fix). The Internet is not less important to global commerce than it was in 2008. Hacker latency continues to be a real problem.
What maybe has changedover the years is the strangely increasing amountoftalk about how the Internet is perhaps too secure. I dont believe that, and I dont believe anyone in business (or even with a credit card) does either. But the discussion on cybersecurity seems dominated by the necessity of insecurity. Did anyone know about this flaw earlier?  Theres absolutely no way to tell. We can only know we need to be finding these bugs faster, understanding these issues better, and fixing them more comprehensively.
We need to not be finding bugs like,eight years from now, again.
(There were clear public signs of impending public discovery of this flaw, so do not take my words as any form of criticism for the release schedule of this CVE.)
My concerns are not merely organizational. I do think we need to start investing significantly more in mitigation technologies that operate before memory corruption has occurred. ASLR, NX, Control Flow Guard  all of these technologies are greatly impressive, at showing us who our greatly impressive hackers are. Theyre not actually stopping code execution from being possible. Theyre just not.
Somewhere between base arithmetic and x86 is a sandbox people cant just walk in and out of. To put it bluntly, if this code had been written in JavaScript  yes, really  it wouldnt have been vulnerable. Even if this network exposed code remained in C, and was justcompiled to JavaScript via Emscripten, it still would not have been vulnerable. Efficiently microsandboxing individual codepathsis a thing we shouldstart exploring. What can we do to the software we deploy, at what cost, to actually make exploitation of software flaws actually impossible, as opposed to merely difficult?
It is unlikely this is the only platform threat, or even the only threat in glibc. With the Internet of Things spreading extraordinarily, perhaps its time to be less concerned about being able to spy on every last phone call and more concerned about how we can make sure innovators have better environments to build upon. Im not merely talking about therather frothy software stacks adorning the Internet of Things, withBluetooth and custom TCP/IP and so on. Im talking about maintainability. When we find problems and we will  can we fix them? This is a problem that took Android too long to start seriously addressing,but theyre not the only ones. A network where devices eventually become existential threats is a network that eventually ceases to exist. What do we dofor platforms to guarantee that attack windows close? What do we do for consumers and purchasing agents so they can differentiate that whichhas a maintenancewarranty, and that which does not?
Are there insurance structures that could pay out, when a glibc level patch needs to be rolled out?
Theres a level of maturity that can be brought to the table, and I think should. There are a lot of unanswered questions about the scope of this flaw, and many others,that perhaps neither vendors nor volunteer researchers are in the best position to answer. We can do better building the secure platforms of the future. Lets start here.

InfluxData (YC W13) Is Hiring a Developer and Product Evangelist
As a Developer and Product Evangelist at InfluxData, your two main jobs will be to educate the community about our TICK stack -- a real-time IoT platform for time-series data -- and to create strong community relationships. Youll be writing blogs, whitepapers, and abstracts for conference submissions. Youll be speaking at conferences, giving webinars, and running workshops at Meetups. You'll be an InfluxData expert, if such a thing as an expert exists.
In your work with the community, youll also be on the lookout for opportunities for InfluxData -- potential leads, technical requirements, wanted features, etc. You may be doing interviews or reading results from them to help figure out what features and marketing campaigns will be best.
To do all this, youve got to be excited about what were doing at InfluxData, and youve got to be quite technical to be able to write, speak, and engage with people about our tools. Youll be writing sample applications that highlight specific use cases for InfluxData, as well as creating sample data sets. Thus, you must have at least a fundamental level of experience with programming.
We're looking for candidates who care about the developers who use our product, who value continually mastering the craft of coding, and who value building tools that benefit the open source development community.Youll be working closely with the Marketing team, but also interacting with pretty much every team at InfluxData, including the InfluxDB team, as well as the Chronograf, Telegraf, and Kapacitor teams. Youll need to be empathic, supportive, and self-aware. You'll need to be open to experimenting, which means that sometimes you might fail. (That's okay.) Along with that, you'll need the persistence to keep going and try again.

Reverse engineering android from binary to source
SmartQ zWatch was a cheap-ish smartwatch that has been available online for the last few years. It came with its own android-based OS and no sources. The updates from the manufacturer were quick initially, but soon stopped. Luckily there was an  "unbrick tool" also published that allows to recover the device no matter its current state. The updates were published as unsigned zip files that the the existing bootloader would apply on boot if found in the /media partition. Some people created some "ROM"s for this watch, but all of them were just small modifications of the stock firmware. My goal was to produce a fully open-source version of Android for this device. Well, Android is already open source, but the device-specific parts for this device clearly are not.
First, I spent a lot of time inspecting the existing OS and libraries using a disassembler. Then I made a fake build from AOSP for the MIPS architecture, and starte dcomparing what files were in one but not the other. There were a lot. One by one I categorized all of them into two piles: important and not. Most of the HALs were obviously important. Most other files were likely not as important. The next step was producing a build that used the existing binaries of the HALs as pre-built but otherwise worked. This actually took quite a lot of time and work, but eventually Android 4.4.4 ran. It did not run well. The screen flickered insanely, audio did not work, WiFi did not work. But it was an encouraging start - it booted. I estimate that to get to this step I used the "unbrick" tool about 200 times on this watch.
There actually was a lot of work that was unrelated to the HALs. I got that out of the way first. Various config files, fstab changes, etc were parts of this change. Also there ewre some changes for make & init files. Overall this took probably another 50 reflashes and tests. Among all this came WiFi and BT firmware files, making WiFi and BT work.
There are 4 HALs that are necessary for this watch and 2 libraries. The HALs are: audio, gralloc, hwcomposer, and sensors. The libraries are: DMMU and GLES. The watch lacks a GPU of any sort and thuse uses software rendering. This is not terribly fast on a 1GHz MIPS CPU, but luckily there are few enough pixels on the screen that this is not debilitating for watch purposes. DMMU is a driver for the IOMMU that is built in to most large peripherals in the JZ4775 CPU. I'll tell here a short story about each HAL & library that I had to produce.
But before all of the userspace work, I decided to take a look at the kernel sources. As per the GPL (under which the Linux kernel is licensed), the manufacturer had to have provided a written offer of sources. Needless to say that a random chinese company (SmartQ, currently owned by Huami) does not care even a little about this sort of thing. I checked theit site every which way I could, and found no sources. Emaling them produced no reply, of course. Of course, why would it? I tried to find some people on LinkedIn who might help, but I was told in no uncertain terms to go away. Ok then... time to fire up the disassembler. I unpacked their stock boot image, then unpacked the compressed kernel image, and then sicced IDA on it. With a whole lot of work, and a script that took the contents of /proc/kallsyms and named functions at those addresses, I had a somewhat useful disassembly of their kernel. It was not nearly enough to reproduce it, but enouhg to provide some light reference material.
The sensors HAL was the first one I tackled. Having the disassembled kernel and a copy of the existing sensor hal made this a relatively easy task. Having never written a full android sensor HAL, it took a little work to sort it all out. But then again, this is an easy HAL. The device only has an accelerometer, and the kernel driver manages pretty much everything about it. Good news: the HAL is simple. Bad news: not much we can do besides gettig samples from it. No fancy effects, no programming it to do tilt detect, nothing. Sad day. Well, at least it works for sensor test apps amd screen rotation. Perhaps we can later modify the kernel driver to allow the HAL to do more. Well, ha!, that is if we ever get the kernel sources.
Graphics system in android (at least as far as I understand it) uses three HALs: GL, Gralloc, and hwcomposer. Gralloc allocates opaque buffers that can be used by GL and hwc. It also frees those buffers, and maps them into the current process's address space if this buffer was sent in from another process. Also the gralloc HAL provides ability to map the framebuffer in to the current address space. One might rightly ask why one needs a special way of allocationg memory in a device with no GPU. True, if we were to use an entirely software graphics pipeline, we could use the generic android hwc and gralloc. But that is not our intention. More about that later. But for now we have to implement gralloc. What will it do? When asked to, allocate a buffer from ashmem, map it, unmap it, release it, etc. The framebuffer part of it will open and close the framebuffer device. All nice and easy. The only unusual thing here is the ioctl used to flip framebuffer buffers is not the normal one. Oh well, a little disassembling of te existing gralloc module solved that mystery.
My goals in writign my hwc is using X2D. It is a 2-D accelerator that is built-in to the JZ4775 SoC. It can rotate, flip, scale, and blend up to 4 layers onto a base layer. Multiple formats are supported. This is not an overlay - it does not overlay anything on top of the screen, it only does compositing to RAM. So I simply allocated a buffer to composite into. This is actually good. That means that if we have to composite more than 4 layers, we can just run X2D's blending engine twice. The docuemtntation on X2D is reasonably good in the JZ4775 manual, if you like "Engrish." I supplemented my reading of the SoC manual with the kernel disassembly and the disassembly of the existing hwc. This was going well, till I realized that the existing hwc did not use many fatures, and used a few badly. In fact the fact that the watch worked at all the way it was shipped was a miracle (more on that later). In any case, I got it to work with proper format conversions and all the scaling/flipping/etc that Android needs. It does work, and rather fast. I then went further and implemented the HWC 1.3 version, including offloading the compositing unto a separate thread (the kernel driver blocks the caling thread till the hardware is done compositing) and support for virtual displays. Since X2D is a hardware block, and has no idea bout the current Linux MMU config, how will it ever find our buffers? DMMU is the answer. More on this later.
GL libraries are necessary for android to talk to the GPU in any device. This becomes much easier if there is no GPU. Android sources do include a software GPU renderer, but it is not built for any targets other than the emulator. Forcing it to build for some reason (which I no longer remember) did not work, so I made a copy and with a few changes it works. Since this is all in software, no special memory handling is needed, and the normal calls into gralloc to lock/unlock buffers work correctly. Some changes did have to be made due to the native pixel order not being RGBA.
I have mentioned that the fact that anything worked at all for the watch as it shipped was a miracle. Why? There were two separate processes independently posting framebuffer udpates. FB hal did it at android's behest sometimes, and hwc did sometimes too. Each flipped the page on the framebuffer, and no locking was used. To combat this sort of thing from happening again I created a new gralloc flag "POSTABLE," If it is not set, a buffer will not post to screen. We set this only on buffers that hwc allocates for compositing into. Problem solved - now anyone can try to post anything they want directly to FB, but only hwc actually can. Cool.
So, about that DMMU thing I mentioned... The CPU in this watch has a few large non-cpu blocks: a video decoder and the X2D graphics accelerator. Both of them have an IOMMU in front of them. It is a weird MMU, unlike the normal MIPS TLB. It is a single-level pagetable assuming 4K pages. This means that each such table takes 4 bytes per each mapped 4K page, and allows no holes. This is actually rather simple. The kernel already has a driver for DMMU, and the userspace library that managed access to this driver was taken from older publishe dingenic sources, with changes to make it cleaner and simpler.
The audio HAL was rather straighforward. It did require some disassembly to learn the ioctl numbers needed to get the kernel audio drivers to do what I wanted it to. Eventually it did all work, and i verified that audio recording from microphone and audio playback over speakers worked. It is at this point that I managed for the first time to play music form Pandora on the watch. This was very very exciting!
I also had to make some bootloader changes. "Hm," you might say - "how did you change the bootloader if it is not open-source?" Well, with a hex editor mostly. I used this to modify the way the bootloader partitioned flash to made /userdata large and make /media as tiny as possible. I also modified the commandline passed to the kernel to make Android M boot on this hardware. The changes were not that large, but they did require quite a bit of diassembly to figure out.
Did I just mention Marshmallow? Yes, I did. So when why am I releasing here images for Android 4.4.4 and not for 6.0? Well, Android 6.0 requires some kernel changes to get WiFi to work well. I did mention that I have no kernel sources, right? Well, that means that Marshmallow will not be able to use WiFi. Not that useful, eh? To be fully accurate, though, these device files I produced WILL in fact allow Marshmallow to boot on this device. But still WiFi will not work till you add the necessary bits to the kernel.
The story does take a rather weird turn at this point. The board name for the watch internally is "s2122b," the watch (and concievably the kernel) was produced by SmartQ, the CPU is made by Ingenic. Ok, so what does this all mean? Ingenic has a few new CPUs out now, including m150. They also have board with these CPUs out there for purchase. So where am I going with all this? Well, idlly looking at the kernel for the "halley" board, i noticed it had a defconfig for a "s2122b" kernel. Whoa! What are the chances that two companies would pick the same board name for independent boards? Well, I figured i'd try. I built it and flashed it. It booted! USB worked, but not much else. Graphics sort of worked, but it kept sliding sideways (like an old TV). I put some work into this kernel, and at this point touch works, graphics work ok, DMMU works, Accelerometer works, and BT works. I am not yet ready to release it since it is not even close to complete, but there is hope. My theory is that s2122b was a proof-of-concept board that Ingenic made. SmartQ then took it, made a watch from it, did not even bother changing the board name. They likely changed a few things in there before shipping. This explains why the kernel I built almost works - it targets an older version of a similar board. Well, it is a start. If yuo want to try to work on this, I am happy to give you a copy, but with no promises!

Kuhn's Paradox

Bradley M. Kuhn








            Friday 19 February 2016 by Bradley M. Kuhn
          


I've been making the following social observation frequently in my talks
              and presentations for the last two years.  While I suppose it's rather
              forward of me to do so, I've decide to name this principle:
I believe this paradox is primarily driven by the cooption of software
              freedom by companies that ostensibly support Open Source, but have the (now
              extremely
              popular) open
              source almost everything philosophy.
For certain areas of software endeavor, companies dedicate enormous
              resources toward the authorship of new Free Software for particular narrow
              tasks.  Often, these core systems provide underpinnings and fuel the growth
              of proprietary systems built on top of them.  An obvious example here is
              OpenStack: a fully Free Software platform, but most deployments of
              OpenStack add proprietary features not available from a pure upstream
              OpenStack installation.
Meanwhile, in other areas, projects struggle for meager resources to
              compete with the largest proprietary behemoths.  Large user-facing,
              server-based applications of
              the Service
              as a Software Substitute variety, along with massive social media sites
              like Twitter and Facebook that actively work against federated social
              network systems, are the two classes of most difficult culprits on this
              point.  Even worse, most traditional web sites have now become a mix of
              mundane content (i.e., HTML) and proprietary Javascript programs, which are
              installed on-demand into the users' browser all day long, even while most
              of those servers run a primarily Free Software operating system.
            
            
Finally, much (possibly a majority of) computer use in industrialized
              society is via hand-held mobile devices
              (usually inaccurately
              described as mobile phones).  While some of these devices
              have Free Software operating systems (i.e., Android/Linux), nearly all the
              applications for all of these devices are proprietary software.
The explosion of for-profit interest in Open Source over the
              last decade has led us to this paradoxical problem, which increases daily
               because the gap between software under a license respects my
              rights to copy, share, and modify and software that's
              essential for my daily activities grows linearly wider with each
              sunset.
I propose herein no panacea; I wish I had one to offer.  However, I
              believe the problem is exacerbated by our community's tendency to ignore
              this paradox, and its pace even accelerates due to many developers' belief
              that having a job writing any old Free Software replaces the need for
              volunteer labor to author more strategic code that advances software
              freedom.

Cameron to announce EU referendum date
 (CNN)[Breaking news update, Saturday, 3:46 a.m. ET]
British Prime Minister David Cameron said he will announce a date for the country's in-or-out referendum on EU membership after a Cabinet meeting on Saturday. "The Cabinet will this morning discuss the UK's new special status in the EU - afterwards I'll announce the planned referendum date," Cameron posted to Twitter.
[Previous story published Friday, 9:45 p.m. ET]
(CNN) -- European Union leaders reached a deal Friday to keep Britain in the organization with "special status," UK Prime Minister David Cameron announced, saying he'll present the deal to his cabinet on Saturday morning.
If approved by the cabinet, the issue would go to the British people in a referendum -- perhaps as early as June --  that would be "a once-in-a-generation moment to shape the destiny of our country," Cameron said at a news conference.
After two days of tense talks in Brussels, Belgium, with other EU leaders, Cameron said the EU provided the concessions he sought, including assurances that the other nations won't try to make Britain part of a "European superstate."
"There will be tough new restrictions on access to our welfare system for EU migrants," he said. "No more something for nothing. Britain will never join the euro, and we've secured vital protections for our economy and a full say over the rules of the free trade single market while remaining outside the euro."

World leaders praised the deal, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying the EU leaders clearly wanted Britain to stay.
"We believe we have now given a package to David Cameron to elicit support in Britain for Britain remaining a member of the European Union," she said. "This was his goal after all. There was no doubt about it."
At the heart of the talks among the 28 EU heads of government were Britain's demands to play by special rules within the union. The demands left some EU leaders cold, but there was no great appetite to see a British exit from the EU -- or "Brexit," as it has come to be known.
A British departure would leave the EU diminished. It would lose its second-largest economy -- behind that of Germany -- and one of its two permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council. (France holds the other)
Cameron was upbeat at his news conference, saying, "Our plan for Europe gives us the best of both worlds."
Britain would maintain full access to the EU's free-trade market and benefit from Europe-wide cooperation on crime and terrorism, he said. 
But Britain would not have to cooperate in "the parts of Europe that don't work for us," such as the euro currency and eurozone bailouts, Cameron said.
"I have negotiated a deal to give the United Kingdom special status inside the European Union," he said. "I will fly back to London tonight and update the cabinet at 10 a.m. tomorrow morning."

The EU sprang from the ashes of World War II as a free-trade zone. Its signal achievement has been to allow free movement of goods and people in the hope that economic integration would prevent a new continental war.
Britain opted out of both those EU provisions, and it views with skepticism the EU's effort to branch into new fields, regulating everything from pesticides to human rights, and creating a unified foreign policy, too.
Merkel said Britain's demand not to pay benefits to migrants from other EU countries had been a sticking point.
"All of the different baskets of the requests of Britain on the agenda were discussed, and it is true that not each and every one around the table had it all that easy to agree to those requests, but there is a will," Merkel said Thursday.
Cameron also wanted to opt out of the standard EU commitment that its members must work toward "ever closer union" -- a goal that has animated the European project for decades.
He wants Britain exempted from having to give various social benefits to newcomers -- even from other EU countries -- until they have lived in the UK for several years.

Britain has resisted the "ever closer" ties with the EU. It is not a member of the Schengen Agreement, which allows for passport-free travel among most European countries. And when many EU countries scrapped their national currencies in favor of the euro, Britain said it would stick with the pound. 
The country's difficult relationship with the EU is nothing new. In the 1960s, French President Charles de Gaulle not only opposed Britain's entry into what was then called the Common Market, he also opposed any negotiations on the topic.
Britain didn't join the European Community, as it was then called, until 1973, by which time de Gaulle was dead.
There's no assurance the British people will approve the referendum.
The historic number of people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East and North Africa -- most of them bound for Europe -- increases the chances that Britons, fearful about their jobs and their national identity, will try to pull up the drawbridge and go it alone.
Furthermore, while Cameron expects to campaign for Britain to stay in the EU, his Conservative Party is divided on the issue, with some senior members favoring an EU exit.
For his part, U.S. President Barack Obama has urged Britain to stay in the EU. The UK as a member of the EU "gives us much greater confidence about the strength of the trans-Atlantic union," Obama said in July. 
Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, said the agreement doesn't compromise "our fundamental values."
"I deeply believe that the United Kingdom needs Europe and Europe needs the United Kingdom," Tusk said. "To break the link now would be totally against our mutual interest. We have done all we could not to let that happen. But the final decision is in the hands of the British people."
Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel tweeted: "We overcame our differences to reach a good #agreement. Now up to British people to decide. Good luck @David_Cameron."
Cameron said economics wasn't the only reason to stay in the EU. Security was another issue, especially in the age of terrorism, Cameron said.
"This, in my view, is a time to stick together, a time for strength in numbers," he said.

Trump: Boycott Apple
Pawley's Island, South Carolina (CNN)Donald Trump on Friday called for a boycott against Apple until the technology giant helps the FBI break into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters.
"Boycott Apple until such time as they give that information," Trump told a crowded room of supporters during a town hall-style event here just one day before the South Carolina GOP primary.
"Apple ought to give the security for that phone, OK. What I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until such a time as they give that security number. How do you like that? I just thought of it. Boycott Apple," Trump said.
"The phone's not even owned by this young thug that killed all these people. The phone's owned by the government, OK, it's not even his phone," Trump said. "But (Apple CEO) Tim Cook is looking to do a big number, probably to show how liberal he is. But Apple should give up, they should get the security or find other people. 
While Trump was speaking, his Twitter account tweeted a Fox News poll from an iPhone. Later Friday, he tweeted, "I use both iPhone & Samsung. If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info."
Soon after, he tweeted, "Boycott all Apple products  until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal."
A senior Apple executive said the tech giant is in fine company based on other people Trump has attacked. The executive said the company is fighting on behalf of its customers. 
Trump's comments come days after Cook said in an open letter that his company was opposing a federal judge's order to provide the FBI with security software to break into one of the San Bernardino terrorist's iPhones.
Cook argued in his open letter that complying with the judge's order would build "a backdoor to the iPhone," which Cook said he considers "too dangerous to create."
Trump is no stranger to calling for boycotts of Fortune 500 companies. He also previously called for a boycott of Macy's after the retail giant pulled Trump's line of clothing from its stores due to Trump's heated rhetoric over undocumented Mexican immigrants.

Tropical Cyclone Winston Slamming Fiji

Sat, 20 Feb 2016 07:51:28 GMT
Strongest-ever tropical cyclone to hit Fiji makes landfall
 (CNN)Tropical Cyclone Winston is now making landfall in Fiji, said CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam. 
The storm, which is the most powerful ever to hit the island nation, was tracked moving through the narrow waterway ocean in between the country's main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.
"Batten down the hatches. It's going to get worse before it gets better," Van Dam said. 
The capital city, Suva, is without electricity, according to The Fiji Times.
Tropical Cyclone Winston is packing winds of 180 mph with gusts over 220 mph -- the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane -- according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The storm is expected to strengthen further before the eye of the storm hits.
"The assault," as Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama put it, has already begun. 
"As a nation, we are facing an ordeal of the most grievous kind," Bainimarama said. "We must stick together as a people and look after each other."
It is the strongest storm on record to make a direct hit on the main islands, which are home to a majority of Fiji's 900,000 people and are smaller than Connecticut.
Warnings from the Tropical Cyclone Center in Fiji caution that destructive wind gusts from Winston could reach up to 225 mph, in addition to damaging rough seas and coastal flooding.
The government imposed a curfew starting at 6 p.m. local time, a statement from the country's disaster management said. 
Prime Minister Bainimarama said that the government is "thoroughly prepared to deal with this crisis."
The government has declared a state of emergency that will be in effect for the next 30 days, The Fiji Times reported.
The tropical cyclone season in this region of the South Pacific runs from November 1 to April 30. Activity for the season is expected to be above average due to the ongoing record El Nio, which has brought above-average water temperatures to much of the Pacific.
Viti Levu, Fiji's main island, has had fewer than 10 direct hits from storms at or above hurricane intensity (sustained winds of 75 mph or greater), according to NOAA. Tropical Cyclone Evan, which struck the island in December 2012, had maximum winds of 145 mph, causing major damage but no fatalities.

Kenya: Al-Shabaab 'intel head killed'
Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)A Kenyan airstrike in Somalia has killed at least 52 militants from the Islamist terror organization Al-Shabaab, including its intelligence chief, the Kenyan military said. But Al-Shabaab denied that there was any strike, and a Somali government official cast doubt on the intelligence chief's death.
The strike earlier this month targeted a camp where the Kenya Defence Forces said the Amniyat, Al-Shabaab's intelligence wing, was training around 80 recruits. 
Mahad Mohammed Karatey, also known as Mahat Karatey, was killed along with 10 mid level Al-Shabaab commanders and 42 recruits, said the KDF, which is part of the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia.
He was attending a graduation ceremony for the recruits, the KDF said.
The U.S. Department of State has designated Karatey as a terrorist and is offering up to $5 million for information locating him.

But Al-Shabaab contradicted the KDF on a radio station sympathetic to their cause -- Radio Andulus -- saying "Al-Shabaab denies that any airstrike targeting Al-Shabaab has taken place. The intention of Kenya is to divert attention from El Adde, [Somali,] where hundreds of Kenyan troops died."
A suicide bombing attack struck an African Union base there in January.

In addition, a Somali intelligence source told CNN that officials do not believe that Karatey is dead. They also believe an Amniyat training program would never involve so many people. 

Karatey is known as a high-level Al-Shabaab commander of the Amniyat.
Kenyan and U.S. authorities believe Karatey was directly involved in the attack on Garissa University in Kenya last year, which killed 148 people. Most of them were students.

Al-Shabaab most recently claimed responsibility for the failed bombing of a Daallo Airlines flight departing Mogadishu in early February. The explosion killed only the bomber and injured two others. But the bomb, said to be sophisticated, was believed to be hidden in a laptop. 
Al-Shabaab is fighting a guerrilla war in Somalia with the intention of imposing Sharia law. It has also regularly carried out attacks with multiple casualties in Kenya and has sworn revenge for that country's military participation against the terrorists in Somalia.
The terror group is officially affiliated with al Qaeda, although last year a fraction pledged allegiance to ISIS.

'New space era': Virgin unveils new spaceship
 (CNN)Virgin Galactic's race to become the first major private space tourism company just got closer to reality.
After more than three years of construction, Richard Branson's company unveiled a new spaceship Friday at the Mojave Air & Space Port in California. It is a replacement for the one that crashed in 2014, killing a test pilot.
Physicist Stephen Hawking named the new vehicle Virgin Spaceship (VSS) Unity in a recorded speech and on Twitter. 
"I would be very proud to fly on this spaceship," Hawking  said.
Branson said the new vehicle means space can be made accessible in a way that has only been dreamed about before. 
 "Our beautiful new spaceship, VSS Unity, is the embodiment of that goal and also a great testament to what can be achieved when true teamwork, great skill and deep pride are combined with a common purpose," Branson said, according to a company press release.
On Thursday, the company said that because of the fatal crash, the new spaceship will not "blast off and head straight to space" anytime soon. Instead, it faces an extensive testing period.
Once the craft has fully checked out, Virgin Galactic plans to use it to ferry passengers up 50 miles above Earth's surface -- a height the company said will qualify them as "bona fide space tourists."
 "One of the things that I think is most powerful is that we'll be able to get a new perspective on our planet as hundreds and eventually millions of people are able to go into space," said George Whitesides, the company's CEO. 
 More than 700 people have signed up to fly on Virgin Galactic -- even though the company requires $250,000 up front for a seat. 
So when will passenger flights begin? The company's tweets and press release are noticeably short on dates. But here are some of the key things that Virgin Galactic said will happen next:
         After the ground tests are done, the spaceship will be flown on the back of its mothership, WhiteKnightTwo.
         Next comes glide testing: The craft flies like a glider from an altitude of 45,000+ feet (8 miles) while pilots test its handling.
         Rocket-powered test flights are next, each flight going a little higher and a little faster. When it crosses 100,000 feet (19 miles), the spaceship will be above 99% of the atmosphere and the pilots will experience weightlessness.
         When it reaches 50 miles (80 kilometers), the pilots will have met NASA and the U.S. Air Force's requirements for official astronaut status, and they will be recognized by the Virgin Galactic team and by the U.S. government as bonafide space travelers.
The company said it has made many updates to the craft -- the most important being the feather inhibitor. The plane's feathers are a critical component of its reentry system. The accident that occurred in 2014 was a result of the feathers being prematurely being unlocked. 
"The actual accident itself was caused by a control being moved when it shouldn't have," said Dave Mackay, the chief pilot for Galactic. "We've implemented a new system, which prevents that from ever happening again.  So it's physically impossible to move that control at the point that it was moved during the accident."
While some of their competitors' ships, such as New Shepard from Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, don't have pilots and instead rely on automation, Virgin Galactic's system is entirely dependent on the skill of its pilots.
"The pilots are controlling what the vehicle does at any stage," Mackay said. "It's all dependent on the pilot."
Mackay said this strategy was pursed by the company for simplicity: "The responsibility is high. But the reason that we've done it in the first place is to keep everything as simple as possible. The rationale is if you have a simple system, it's less likely to fail, and is therefore inherently safer."
Becoming a member of Virgin's elite pilot corps is no easy feat.  Virgin has five pilots, whose resumes all have the "right stuff" -- military, commercial, and test flying experience. Mackay himself has flown over 140 different types of aircraft.
When asked what it takes to be a Virgin Galactic pilot, Mackay said, "We look for the most experienced test pilots that we can get. Test flying is important, because we're in the test and development phase of the vehicle.  And we're doing something which is unique.  It's very, very unusual."
Virgin's pilots also undergo intense training, using a sophisticated simulator until the spaceship is operational.
And while it will never be quite the same as actually being in space, Mackay said the time in the simulator is extremely valuable: "This is as close as you can get to actually recreating it. You can't simulate the high G forces that we will feel during the rocket motor burn.  And of course you can't simulate the extended zero G experience.  You couldn't do that in any simulation sort of device.  But this is a hugely valuable tool for practicing flying the vehicle, how you operate it, how you operate it efficiently, and how the systems work, and what to do if a particular system or component might fail."
 And not only is the simulator work valuable for pilot training, but it also helps with the actual spaceship design process:  "A lot of the the work that we've done improving the vehicle, and developing the vehicle is done in the simulator first of all.  And then if we like what we've seen in the simulator we incorporate it in the actual vehicle itself."
 Even when Virgin Galactic finally takes up its first passengers, it won't be the first time civilians have gone to space. The world's first paying space tourist was American businessman and former NASA engineer Dennis Tito. 
 Tito flew to the International Space Station in 2001. His ride up? A Russian Soyuz rocket. He paid $20 million for the trip.
 Six other people also flew as tourists to the space station.
 Now that the new spaceship is closer to flying, the dream of civilian space travel for the non-millionaire crowd is closer to reality.
 "It's a significant moment I think in aviation history," said Mackay. "This is the vehicle that is going to take many hundreds of regular people into space for the first time."

U.S. bombs ISIS terror leaders
 (CNN)American warplanes hit an ISIS camp in Libya where foreign fighters had been engaged in advanced training, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Friday.
Noureddine Chouchane, a senior operative in the terrorist group from Tunisia, was believed to be among those from around Africa and the Middle East who had converged on the site, Earnest said. It was not immediately clear whether Chouchane was killed, Earnest said.
Chouchane is thought to have played an instrumental role in two terrorist attacks in Tunisia last year, one at Tunis' Bardo Museum that killed 23 people and another at a seaside resort in Sousse that left 38 people dead. ISIS claimed responsibility for both massacres.
Friday morning's U.S. strike in the al-Qasser district in Sabratha, a coastal city in northwestern Libya where most residents are from Tunisia, killed at least 49 people, Hussain al-Thawadi, the Mayor of Sabratah, said.
Al-Thawadi told Libya TV in an interview the death toll could rise because more people might still be under the rubble. He said the house was rented by suspected ISIS members and he believed more than 60 people were inside it when it was hit.
Also six people were wounded, according to the Sabratha Municipal Council. 
A Libyan man started to expand the house in Sabratha to several levels last year, security officials in the city said. He had brought in several groups of fighters over the past few months, including one batch two days ago. That house was struck Friday.
Over the last several weeks, the United States observed militants moving around the site and undergoing what appeared to be special training, according to a U.S. official. 
"This was outside the normal training camp scenario," the official said.
The activity raised concerns the people there might be planning to launch an external attack, though no details were discovered about where or when this might take place.
Al-Thawadi described the site as an ISIS recruitment base for foreigners, mostly from Tunisia. He said a Jordanian woman was among the dead.
The U.S. military has launched hundreds of airstrikes against ISIS targets over the past two years. These have been concentrated in Iraq and Syria, where the Islamist extremist group has established its biggest foothold and has its de facto capital in Raqqa.
But Libya -- a North African nation that's been in turmoil, and a hotbed for some militant groups, since a 2011 revolution that toppled its longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi -- has been in its crosshairs as well. 

ISIS has emerged as the world's top terrorist threat, having conducted or inspired about 70 attacks in 20 countries since declaring its caliphate in June 2014. Not including its armed campaigns in Syria and Iraq, these attacks have killed at least 1,200 people and injured more than 1,700 others.
Mapping ISIS attacks worldwide
It is significant that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi exerts more control over the ISIS branch in Libya than any other, according to a report late last year to the United Nations Security Council. This conclusion is in line with U.S. intelligence determinations that al-Baghdadi sees the relatively lawless, impoverished North African state as prime ground to enlarge his caliphate.
As such, ISIS has been expanding into in many places in Libya, like Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte. The group has asserted itself by taking over territory and sadistically exercising terror, as evidenced by its beheadings of Egyptian Coptic Christians about a year ago on a Libyan beach.
Libya has also been a base to train militants, devise plots and launch them in places like neighboring Tunisia, which has been considered the Arab Spring's success story but has not been immune to the violence wrenching the region.
The Bardo Museum and Sousse beach attacks are gut-wrenching proof of that, not just because of the human carnage but also for their negative effects on a Tunisian economy that's long benefited from tourism.
Both attacks were carried out by one terror cell whose members came from Tunisia, communicated with ISIS leaders in Syria and Iraq, and trained in Libya, a Western counterterrorism source said. That training happened near Sabratha, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) east of the Tunisian border where the Friday morning strike took place. 
The same cell planned to attack France's diplomatic complex in Tunis, only to be thwarted as Tunisian security forces moved in, according to the source. All of its roughly half dozen core members -- at least those not killed in attacks -- who were still in Tunisia are now in custody. But others involved in the plots may not be in the country, possibly finding refuge in their former training ground in Libya instead.

It's no surprise the United States would help Tunisia. Last May, President Barack Obama cemented America's strong ties by designating the country as "a major non-NATO ally."
"I emphasized to the (Tunisian) President that the United States is fully committed to working with Tunisia so that it can continue to build on (its past) success," Obama said in Washington alongside his Tunisian counterpart, Beji Caid Essebsi.
Chouchane has been a focus for Tunisia since its Interior Ministry identified him and several others as planners of the Bardo Museum attack.
The 30-something man hails from the central town of Chouachnia in the Sidi Bouzid governorate, an area that's a breeding ground for many jihadists.
Friday's airstrike isn't just about Chouchane or Tunisia. It's also about the larger fight against terrorists, particularly in Libya.
A U.S. airstrike in Libya last November killed Abu Nabil, an Iraqi national and longtime al Qaeda operative who'd become an ISIS leader, the Pentagon said. 
Less than a month later, the American military killed Abdirahman Sandhere, a senior leader of the al Qaeda-affiliated group Al-Shabaab, according to a statement from Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook. That was around the time U.S. Special Operations forces reportedly landed in Libya, only to turn around and head back a short time later.
And a few weeks ago, Obama's top military adviser talked about stepping up efforts to curtail ISIS specifically in the North African country.
Addressing reporters while traveling in Europe, Gen. Joseph Dunford, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, said the United States wants to "take decisive military action" to "check" ISIS in Libya.

Fiji braces for strongest-ever tropical cyclone hit
 (CNN)Fiji is bracing for a direct hit from a massive tropical cyclone, which will move over the main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu this weekend.
Tropical Cyclone Winston is packing winds of 180 mph with gusts over 200 mph -- the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane -- according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The storm is expected to strengthen further before the eye of the storm hits the islands late Saturday night local time. 
It is the strongest storm on record to make a direct hit on the main islands, which are home to a majority of Fiji's 900,000 people and are smaller than Connecticut.
Warnings from the Tropical Cyclone Center in Fiji caution that destructive wind gusts from Winston could reach up to 225 mph, in addition to damaging rough seas and coastal flooding.
The tropical cyclone season in this region of the South Pacific runs from November 1 to April 30. Activity for the season is expected to be above average due to the ongoing record El Nio, which has brought above-average water temperatures to much of the Pacific.
Viti Levu, Fiji's main island, has had fewer than 10 direct hits from storms at or above hurricane intensity (sustained winds of 75 mph or greater), according to NOAA. Tropical Cyclone Evan, which struck the island in December 2012, had maximum winds of 145 mph, causing major damage but no fatalities.

'Mockingbird' author Harper Lee dies
 (CNN)Harper Lee, whose debut novel, "To Kill a Mockingbird," immortalized her name with its story of justice and race in a small Southern town and became a classic of American literature, has died. She was 89.
Her death was confirmed Friday by the City Hall in Monroeville, Alabama, where she lived. 
In a statement, Lee's family said, "The family of Nelle Harper Lee, of Monroeville, Alabama, announced today, with great sadness, that Ms. Lee passed away in her sleep early this morning.  Her passing was unexpected.  She remained in good basic health until her passing.  The family is in mourning and there will be a private funeral service in the upcoming days, as she had requested."
Added nephew Hank Conner in the statement, "This is a sad day for our family.  America and the world knew Harper Lee as one of the last century's most beloved authors.  We knew her as Nelle Harper Lee, a loving member of our family, a devoted friend to the many good people who touched her life, and a generous soul in our community and our state.  We will miss her dearly."
Reaction from people moved by Lee's work, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and Congressman John Lewis (both Alabama natives), actor Matthew Modine, author John Green and Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who had been jailed in Iran, was swift.
"I re-read #tokillamockingbird during my trial. Touched me much more than when I first read it in high school. Rest in peace Harper Lee," Rezaian tweeted.
Her publisher, HarperCollins, also released a statement.
"The world knows Harper Lee was a brilliant writer but what many don't know is that she was an extraordinary woman of great joyfulness, humility and kindness," said the company's president and publisher, Michael Morrison. "She lived her life the way she wanted to- in private- surrounded by books and the people who loved her.  I will always cherish the time I spent with her."
"Mockingbird," which was published in 1960, was drawn from elements of Lee's childhood in Monroeville. In steady prose shaded by memory and lyricism, she describes how an impulsive girl, Scout Finch, her older brother, Jem, their friend Dill and a variety of other townspeople get caught up in the case of Tom Robinson, a black man who's been accused of rape in the Depression-era town of Maycomb, Alabama.
Through it all, no character is more indelible than that of Scout's widower father, Atticus Finch. The scrupulous, fair-minded lawyer who defends the falsely accused Robinson in a racist courtroom set a standard for goodness and bravery that still resonates more than 50 years later. 
"I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand," Atticus says to Scout at one point. "It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see through it no matter what."
The book won the Pulitzer Prize, and Gregory Peck, who played Atticus in the acclaimed 1962 movie, earned an Oscar for best actor. Finch was named the greatest hero in movie history in a 2003 American Film Institute survey. His reputation is such that a 2010 poll by the American Bar Association Journal was titled "The 25 Greatest Fictional Lawyers (Who Are Not Atticus Finch)." 
An earlier draft of the book, titled "Go Set a Watchman," was published in 2015. The book was criticized for a different portrayal of Atticus, who voices racist sentiments, and questions arose as to whether Lee actually wanted it released. 
Differences between 'Mockingbird,' 'Watchman'
Despite mixed reviews, the book was one of the top sellers of 2015.
Throughout all this, Lee maintained a low profile. She had assisted her friend Truman Capote, the basis for Dill, while he researched his novel "In Cold Blood," and though he reveled in the praise and fortune that came with fame, she resisted it.
"I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird,'" she told critic Roy Newquist for an interview published in 1964. "I didn't expect the book to sell in the first place. I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of reviewers, but at the same time I sort of hoped that maybe someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected."  
Even as "Mockingbird" became a fixture on high school reading lists and demands for her became ever more pronounced, she took shelter in New York and Alabama, hiding in plain sight. It wasn't that she was reclusive, exactly; it's that she preferred to let her work speak for itself.
At one event in her honor -- and there were many -- she was asked to address the audience at the Alabama Academy of Honor. She turned down the opportunity. 
"Well, it's better to be silent than be a fool," she said.

Nelle Harper Lee was born in Monroeville on April 28, 1926. She was the youngest of five children born to Amasa Coleman (A.C.) Lee and Frances Cunningham Finch. Though A.C. was not a widower like Atticus, Lee's mother was mentally ill, so she and her siblings were essentially raised by her father. The two became very close. 
She met Truman Persons, who was two years older, as a child. The tomboyish Lee and the sometimes petulant Persons, who was sent away by his parents to spend his summers in Monroeville, became close friends and would spend hours reading and making up stories. Recognizing his daughter's imaginative temperament, A.C. Lee gave her an Underwood typewriter. She carried it everywhere.
Harper Lee: Fast Facts
Lee attended the University of Alabama, including a short stint in law school, but didn't finish. Instead, she moved to New York where Truman Persons, now Truman Capote, had established himself as one of the country's leading writers. 
Lee, too, wanted to write but had little time to pursue the vocation until a pair of Capote's friends, Michael and Joy Brown, gave her a Christmas gift: They would pay all her expenses for a year. Lee took two to write "To Kill a Mockingbird."
Though the book seems effortless, she told Newquist it came in stops and starts.
"Naturally, you don't sit down in 'white hot inspiration' and write with a burning flame in front of you," she said. "But since I knew I could never be happy being anything but a writer, and 'Mockingbird' put itself together for me so accommodatingly, I kept at it because I knew it had to be my first novel, for better or for worse."
After she finished "Mockingbird," Capote -- fresh off the success of "Breakfast at Tiffany's" -- invited her to assist him on a new project: the story of a murdered Kansas family, the Clutters. Lee became part secretary, part interviewer, part go-between for the flamboyant Capote. The work they did would become the foundation of Capote's 1966 best-seller, "In Cold Blood."
"Mockingbird" was published in July 1960 and became an immediate best-seller. Indeed, it's never stopped selling; as of 2006, it had sold 30 million copies and moves a million more each year.
Lee was caught off guard by its success.
"I can't say that (my reaction) was one of surprise. It was one of sheer numbness. It was like being hit over the head and knocked cold," she told Newquist.

The book won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and was optioned for a movie. Lee was wary of Hollywood's attention but was allowed some input. Her choice for Atticus was Spencer Tracy, but he was unavailable. The studio's first choice was Rock Hudson.
When Gregory Peck was chosen, he traveled to Monroeville to meet with Lee. He became so attuned to the role that Lee burst into tears the first time she saw him in character. The two became lifelong friends. After filming concluded, Lee gave the actor her father's prized pocket watch; later, Peck's grandson was named for the author.
The movie has been called "the best-ever book-to-screen adaptation." It captured Lee's world just right: the dilapidated homes, the county courthouse (built on a backlot but based on the actual Monroeville building) and, above all, her characters. 
The performers who played Scout and Jem, Mary Badham and Philip Alford, were Alabama-born acting novices. Brock Peters, who played Tom Robinson, broke away from the heavies he'd portrayed before landing the role. (More than five decades later, he would deliver the eulogy at Peck's funeral.) Robert Duvall, who played the mysterious Boo Radley, was a screen newcomer. He would go on to a storied career.
With the success of the film, "To Kill a Mockingbird's" place in the culture was cemented. But Lee never followed up. She worked on a second novel but never finished it. Later she tried her hand at a true-crime book. That, too, would remain incomplete. 
"Go Set a Watchman" was an earlier version of "Mockingbird." The book engendered its share of controversy over concerns that Lee, by then in an assisted-living facility, hadn't approved its release, despite a statement that she was "humbled and amazed that this will now be published."
Regardless, "Mockingbird" was a career in itself. 
The story was both a steady source of income and, eventually, somewhat of a millstone for Lee. She spent many years sharing a house in Monroeville with her sister, Alice, a centenarian who followed in her father's footsteps as a lawyer. Strangers would knock on the door and ask for autographs. Lee sued a local museum over trademark infringement. She got caught up in a lawsuit in which she claimed she was "duped" into signing over the copyright to her book. The suit was settled in 2013.
Over the years, biographers and reporters would attempt to get close to Lee. For the most part, she resisted their blandishments, though one teacher, Charles Shields, wrote a 2006 biography, and a Midwestern journalist, Marja Mills, moved next door and eventually wrote a book, "The Mockingbird Next Door" (2014).  By then, Harper Lee had suffered a stroke and both Lees needed more detailed care.
Nevertheless, there is no forgetting "Mockingbird." The film lives on; it's in the National Film Registry. Each year, Monroeville puts on a staged version of the story. 
And, of course, there is the book, still selling, still being read, still moving many to tears.
The book, and its author, offer two qualities that are often in short supply: respect and restraint.
Perhaps there is no more moving example than a famous scene from the book and movie. Atticus Finch has just lost the rape trial. His client, Tom Robinson, will probably be put to death. In the balcony, Scout and Jem sit with Maycomb's black community in stunned silence. As Atticus quietly leaves the courtroom, the Reverend Sykes, a local black leader, gets Scout's attention. The citizens on the balcony are all standing. He urges her to do the same.
"Miss Jean Louise," he says, "stand up. Your father's passin'."
Lee never married and had no children.

Philosopher, writer Umberto Eco dies, 84
 (CNN)Author Umberto Eco, famous for the novels "Foucault's Pendulum" and "The Name of the Rose," died Friday, said Lori Glazer, spokeswoman for his U.S. publisher. 
Eco was 84.
"Umberto Eco was one of the great novelists and scholars of our time. Yet even more than for his timeless works, we will remember him for his exuberance, his vitality, his intense loyalties, and his wonderful company," said Bruce Nichols of publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.
Eco was the recipient of the Premio Strega, Italy's most prestigious literary award, was named a Chevalier de la Lgion d'Honneur by the French government, and is an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, according to his publisher.
He was born in Alessandria in northwest Italy and studied medieval philosophy and literature at the University of Turin. 
Though Eco was probably best known for his novels, he wrote and taught philosophy for many years, exploring such disciplines as semiotics and linguistics, among others.
He held positions at Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Northwestern, Cambridge, Oxford and the University of Bologna, according to his website.
"I am a philosopher; I write novels only on the weekends," Eco told Britain's Guardian newspaper last year. "As a philosopher I am interested in truth. Since it is very difficult to decide what's true or not I discovered that it's easier to arrive at truth through the analysis of fakes."
His book "The Name of the Rose" was adapted into a movie starring Sean Connery.

Russia to destroy asteroids with missiles
Washington  (CNN)Russia plans to modify some of its intercontinental ballistic missiles to destroy asteroids before they hit Earth, according to a top Russian rocket researcher.
Sabit Saitgarayev of Russia's Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau revealed the effort during an interview last week with the government-owned TASS news agency.
The United States is also working on ways to prevent asteroids from hitting Earth, but is taking a very different approach. Instead of blowing up the space rocks, NASA plans to shove them away from the planet.
READ: How NASA will save the earth from giant asteroids
It is the latest frontier in efforts by both countries to tackle a threat to the planet that dates at least from the extinction of the dinosaurs.
The Russian missiles would be used to target smaller asteroids of 20 meters to 50 meters in diameter.
These smaller asteroids can cause significant damage and can sometimes be detected only by observatories a few hours in advance of their reaching Earth.
Sometimes, they aren't detected at all. In 2013, a 20-meter-wide meteor exploded in the sky over Chelyabinsk, Russia, with the estimated force of 300,000 tons of TNT or more, shattering glass in buildings and leaving more than 1,000 people injured.
READ: Russia starts cleanup after meteor strike
None of Earth's space agencies saw it coming.
"Unfortunately, we only know about roughly 1% of those asteroids that get down to the 30-meter size, so there's a tremendous amount out there that we have yet to discover," noted Jason Kessler, the director of NASA's effort to find all asteroid threats to human populations.
Larger asteroids can cause much more damage but can be detected early by space observatories using advanced telescopes and infrared technology.
Kessler said that NASA calculates it has "discovered about 95% of the one kilometer or larger asteroids," roughly the size of the one thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs upon impact.
READ: How to land a space probe on a comet
Unlike rockets that deliver satellites to orbit or ferry people and supplies to the space station, intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, are designed to be used during a war and can launch at a moment's notice. 
The prospect of Russia modifying nuclear missiles for outer space is likely to cause alarm within the U.S. military. The office of the Director of National Intelligence has already expressed concern about Russian military activities in space. 
Its 2016 threat assessment says that Russia continues "to pursue weapons systems capable of destroying satellites on orbit." The assessment notes that "the Russian Duma officially recommended in 2013 that Russia resume research and development of an airborne antisatellite missile to 'be able to intercept absolutely everything that flies from space.'"
Russia has large numbers of nuclear-armed ICBMs in its strategic arsenal that could potentially be converted. It is unclear if the Russian plan would use a conventional explosive in the repurposed missile, but its targeting system is likely to require significant modifications.
Saitgarayev acknowledged in the TASS interview that the modifications would take time and cost millions of dollars but said they are aiming to test the new missile against the larger 355-yard asteroid Apophis that is due to pass close to Earth in 2036.
Astrophysics professor Henry Melosh of Purdue University cautioned against the nuclear option, calling the effort "misguided and potentially dangerous."
Melosh worked on NASA's Deep Impact mission. The spacecraft dropped an impactor onto a comet in 2005.
Melosh downplayed the threat posed by smaller asteroids and told CNN, "There are other, safer ways to deflect asteroids with long lead times." 
He pointed to kinetic deflection, which would fire a rocket into the asteroid to knock it off course, or gravity tractors, which uses a spaceships gravity field to nudge the asteroid off its trajectory.
"For now, the best thing we can do is to identify potentially hazardous asteroids in space and project their time and location of impact," he said.
READ: Life on Mars? Depends how you see these photos
According to Melosh, there are also ongoing efforts at the two U.S. nuclear weapons research centers, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, to investigate the possibility of using nuclear weapons against larger asteroids with long warning times.
Paul Miller, associate division leader of the Design Physics Division at Lawrence Livermore, told CNN that the institution was "supporting NASA by modeling deflection techniques, including kinetic impactors or nuclear explosions."
Miller added, "We know of no interest in the U.S. in repurposing ICBMs" and questioned their utility in preventing asteroid impacts.
Deflection intercepts need to occur months, years or decades in advance, and the associated intercept locations are typically very far from Earth, he said.
And he assessed that other developments would be more effective.
As asteroid detection surveys improve, he said, "they should provide decades of warning. In that case, a ready-to-launch capability is unnecessary."
NASA wouldn't address the possibility of using nuclear weapons to destroy asteroids and would not comment on the viability of the Russian undertaking, but is emphasizing its nonnuclear approach.
One way NASA plans to protect Earth from asteroids is to push the asteroids away from the planet. The space agency is developing an Asteroid Redirect Mission -- the "first-ever robotic mission to visit a large near-Earth asteroid" and "redirect it into a stable orbit around the moon."
This mission is primarily intended to study asteroids and is projected to be ready for deployment in the 2020s.
Ben Reed, who heads up the team developing the Redirect Mission, told CNN in June that the robotic lander could use its thrusters to nudge an asteroid off a collision course with Earth. Or alternatively, he said, the lander could use its own gravitational pull to make slight changes to an asteroid's trajectory if it were deemed a danger.
"We have the technologies to mitigate any potential threats," Reed said.
NASA also announced in January that it has formalized its program for detecting and tracking asteroids that could threaten Earth. The new program is called the Planetary Defense Coordination Office. NASA said the office will take a leading role in coordinating a response to any potential asteroid impacts.
READ: How asteroid can help us reach Mars
In a press release announcing the office, the agency said its "long-term planetary defense goals include developing technology and techniques for deflecting or redirecting objects that are determined to be on an impact course with Earth."

Where presidential statues go to die
 (CNN)In a field in Williamsburg, Virginia, a ghostly army of U.S. presidents appears buried chest-deep, as if caught in a nightmarish quicksand.
George Washington's nose -- or what's left of it -- struggles to stay attached to his crumbling concrete face. Stains streak from his dead eyes like tears. The back of his head is a battered mess of exposed metal rods.
Welcome to intriguing remains of America's Presidents Park, the failed museum where visitors once walked among 43 eerily lifelike busts of the nation's leaders. 
More than five years after the sculpture park closed, its hefty 20ft presidents remain clustered together on Howard Hankins' nearby farm. 
The concrete businessman, who helped build the original sculpture park, couldn't bear to see the stony-faced men destroyed when the tourist attraction closed in 2010, and instead moved them to his own property.
He now hopes to restore the busts to their former glory and exhibit them in a new museum -- which would also feature President Barack Obama and previous First Ladies.
Photographer Patrick Joust traveled to the farm to document the dilapidated monuments, finding that the more famous the president -- the greater the decay.
"The ones that had a large amount of decay included Woodrow Wilson and Abraham Lincoln," he added.
"Funnily enough, a lot of the lesser-known presidents seemed better preserved."

Joust also brought his two-year-old son on the photoshoot and was struck by the way the youngster, who didn't recognize the stern presidents, took a more playful approach.
"I was always fascinated by the kitschy nature of the statues," explained Joust. "Finding them in a somewhat forlorn place, crumbling away, had obvious symbolism.
"It seemed to symbolize the crumbling state of the 'Great Man' narrative that we use to simplify and obfuscate history."

With around $240 of Hankins' $500,000 campaign raised at time of writing, whether these great men will rise again, remains to be seen.

Lions on the loose in Nairobi
 (CNN)Several lions left a mostly enclosed park and wandered into neighborhoods in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, leaving residents on edge and officials scrambling to find the animals.
Two of the big cats -- a lioness and her cub -- were safely back at the Nairobi National Park by Friday afternoon. At least two others remained missing, Kenya Wildlife Service spokesman Paul Udoto said. 
The public reported seeing lions in crowded residential areas at predawn Friday, springing the wildlife service's search teams into action.
Udoto said the lions still on the loose would likely return to the park before daybreak Saturday. He did not say how the first two lions made their way back.

The park near Nairobi's central business district is largely bounded by an electric fence to keep animals inside.
But its south side -- away from the city -- is instead bordered by a river. It wasn't immediately clear what path the lions took to sneak out of the park and enter the residential areas.
 Animals at the park include leopards, buffaloes and giraffes grazing in open spaces, with the city's skyline in the background.

Officials urged vigilance and warned residents to call a toll-free number if they spot the big cats. 
"Our team has been on ground since 3 a.m. to ensure that the ... lions are safely back," the Kenya Wildlife Service tweeted. 

A caller told wildlife officials the animals were seen near a Nairobi hospital, and included a lioness and cubs.

High fliers confident Asia will beat airline slump
Singapore (CNN)Order books may have been slower to open, but optimism has reigned at the Singapore Airshow this week given the bright prospects for aviation growth in the region.
More than 650 delegates from around the world made their way to Asia's largest air show for four intense opening days of showcasing their products to the world. 
This year, the Changi Exhibition Center boasts the largest display of static aircraft since its first edition, with over 60 commercial, private, military and experimental aircraft.
The biannual show is being held February 16-21, just five months ahead of the Farnborough Airshow in London -- the world's second largest -- which marks its 50th show in July. 

Orders and agreements are never as big in Singapore as in London or Paris (Le Bourget), but the economic significance of this show is paramount for the Asia-Pacific commercial aviation and defense industry.
In 2014, more than $32 billion in orders and agreements were signed in Singapore (a 3% increase over 2012), but expectations for this year's show remained low as rumors of an upcoming aerospace downturn have been floating in the air.
"Some people are saying we're in the middle of a bubble," Airbus COO John Leahy said at a press conference. "But reality is, the only thing that worries me is to not be able to deliver the aircraft our customers have ordered."
In fact, both Airbus and Boeing have strong backlogs and even though sales have been weak during the past year, optimism remains high at both manufacturing houses as the number of airplanes they have to deliver is, in Leahy's words, large.
Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg agreed that worries of an upcoming crisis are unfounded. 
He said aircraft demand will increase at a much faster pace than economic growth, as income and urbanization will continue to rise in Asia. 
Embraer's CCO John Slattery concurred, saying demand for new regional jets in the Asia-Pacific region will escalate to 6,350 new aircraft by 2020.

Most of this growth will be powered by China, where urbanization and middle-class growth will require an enhanced aviation infrastructure. 
"By 2025, there will be 200 mega-cities in China," said Andreas Meisel, COO of the Ameco Beijing maintenance/repair (MRO) center, at the Asia Business Forum on the show's second day. 
"Each of these cities will need to be connected by air and rail, and this needs to be properly forecasted by both airplane manufacturers and the Chinese government."
Asia is, in fact, becoming the aviation epicenter of the world. 
Both mainline and low-cost carriers (LCC) are introducing new routes and demand continues to rise. 
Aircraft manufacturers and MROs are heavily investing in the region. 
Airbus has an A320 final assembly line in Tianjin, China, while Boeing produces key parts for its several programs at different locations throughout Asia, and expects to build a 737 completion center in China as well.
The Brazilian regional jet manufacturer, Embraer, also sees big opportunities in Asia. 
"One of every four Embraer aircraft will be delivered to the Asia-Pacific region in the next 10 years," Mark Dunnachie, VP Asia Pacific, said at a press briefing. 
"We have the momentum of 176 sales and over 100 deliveries in 2015 -- a strong 60% market share in the regional jet segment."
Dunnachie said Embraer plans to improve on the current LCC model in Asia, which he called unsustainable and in need of change. 
"Direct connectivity is key for the development of air transport in the Asia-Pacific region," he said. "For those who travel from A to C, they have to go via B." 
That's not a practical solution for the traveler, he said. 
"Direct connectivity is a must, and Embraer will provide that solution."

The recent rout in oil prices have taken a bite out of the sales prospects of all new, fuel-efficient aircraft, evidenced at the recent Dubai Air Show and now in Singapore. 
Vinay Bhaskara, senior business analyst at Airways Magazine, notes that the impetus for new fuel-saving technologies came at a time when oil prices were above the $90/barrel mark. 
"The Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo technologies offer cash savings in operating cost per seat miles of up to 8% (about $3 savings per gallon) against its preceding technology," he says. "With current fuel prices, airlines are looking at pricing and capital deployment rather than fuel-saving capabilities." 
In other words, fuel-efficient aircraft have shifted from being essential purchases to nice-to-haves. 
And that's being reflecting in the order books.

Both Boeing and Airbus secured small, yet significant orders in Singapore. 
The American-based builder announced a commitment for 12 Boeing 737s (eight -8 MAX, three -9 MAX and one -900ER) with China's first privately owned airline, Okay Airways. 
In the announcement, Boeing CEO Ray Conner noted that the Beijing-based carrier became the first in its country to launch the 737-9 MAX. 
That airplane has been unsuccessful in the competition against the Airbus A321neo -- what Airbus' Leahy called "the airline's favorite." 
Leahy, in fact, took the opportunity to poke Boeing's chest: "I know the 'paper airplane company' in Seattle loves to talk, I could give Boeing some advice on how to fill that hole," referring to Airbus's 68% dominance in the neo vs. MAX programs. 
Airbus, for its part, announced an order for six A350-900s from Philippine Airlines, which will expand the airline's reach into the United States and Europe. 
The airline signed a memorandum of understanding worth $1.8 billion at list prices. 
In addition, the Toulouse-based manufacturer announced that an undisclosed customer ordered 14 A330-900neo, bringing up the count to 186 aircraft for the new re-engined A330 program backlog.

In the regional jet segment, Miami-based Aerolease Aviation signed a letter of intent (LOI) for 10 Mitsubishi Regional Jets (MRJ) and options for 10 more. 
This deal marks the first order for brand-new aircraft for the leasing company, which had specialized in dealing used cargo aircraft in the past. 
It's the first leasing company to show interest in the MRJ program.
In the turbo-prop segment, Aviation PLC -- a leasing company based in Singapore --ordered five ATR 72-600s turbo props, valued at $130 million. 
"The ATR is a superb aircraft for lessors," said Patrick de Castelbajac, CEO of ATR. "Our success among leasing firms underlines our product's ability to consolidate and expand regional connectivity in different operational environments."

Its Canadian counterpart, Bombardier, announced a new 90-seat variant for its Q400 turboprop program, to enter service by 2018. 
No similar aircraft in the market will have such capacity for passengers and cargo.
Bombardier also announced that Air Canada signed an LOI to purchase 75 CS300 aircraft, which includes 45 firm orders and 30 options with substitution rights to the smaller variant, the CS100. 
This order gives life to the suffering CSeries program, which hadn't seen any firm orders since September 2014.
British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce said a new variant of its successful Trent XWB engine will fly with Singapore Airlines on its A350s. 
The carrier plans to take delivery of its first A350-900 in 2019. 
That plane will begin flying nonstop to the United States, resuming the airline's direct flights to Los Angeles and the world's longest to New York, both suspended in November 2013. 
Rolls-Royce says the new engine, with enhanced performance, will offer a 1% improvement in fuel burn over the preceding version. 
The British manufacturer claims to have a 50% market share in global orders for widebody aircraft engines.

Qatar Airways and its controversial CEO, Akbar Al Baker, were at the show with the airline's two newest airliners, the Airbus A380 and A350. 
Al Baker told reporters he's seeking compensation from Airbus after rejecting the delivery of the first A320neo powered by Pratt & Whitney's PW 1100GTF engines in December because of alleged cooling issues. 
Al Baker said PW is a long way from providing a solution, and until then the airline will not take delivery of the aircraft.
Despite the low number of orders and commitments, there was an overall feeling that the aviation industry in the region is booming and there's nothing but a bright future ahead for airlines, manufacturers and MRO businesses. 
All eyes remain on Farnborough in July, where perhaps Boeing could announce its long-waited middle-of-the-market airliner, and Airbus could decide on a larger A350, adding a new page to this never-ending competition story.
Enrique Perrella is the editor in chief of Maimi-based Airways Magazine.

Saturday Night Live! From Cairo!
Cairo, Egypt (CNN)Nervous cigarette smoke fills the lounge, wafting through the night's preparatory chaos. The crinkling of scripts mixes with the hum of crew members ironing costumes and makeup artists adding final touches.
Cast members polish their characters in front of mirrors, perfecting movements. The curtain rises in an hour on the first episode of "Saturday Night Live in Arabic."
In the shadow of the Pyramids of Giza lies Studio Misr, Egypt's oldest production house. A large marquee broadcasts the show's name in lights. The recently renovated studio smells of wet paint from the night's sets. 
The cast is as humble as they are funny. For many, this is their first time doing comedy. They are young; ranging between 19 years old to their mid-30s. The oldest staff member is 41. Some appear insecure about their new roles, but that evaporates in front of the live studio audience.
At a glance, there is not much that is funny about the current state of the Middle East. Civil war rages in multiple countries, ISIS' tentacles spread across the region, and millions of refugees flock to Europe. 
But cast member Shadi Alfons says there is "way more to this part of the world than what people see in the news."
He says he and fellow cast member Khalid Mansour are an example: "We are just a couple of bald, idiot comedians who try to get on TV and make people laugh about things we shouldn't make them laugh about."

One sketch opens with twin babies in the womb, trying to determine where they are going to be born. 
First they think Sweden and they'll be rich and successful. 
Then they realize their skin color is darker so they think maybe Italy or Spain. 
Listening to the conversation in the room, they hear Arabic and think they'll be rich in Dubai. 
Finally, they hear a very Egyptian word and freak out, refusing to be born.  
The show won't shy away from the region's mounting problems, but hopes to tackle them with a unique sense of humor.
"We are trying to do something original. We aren't trying to break taboos but like one the way we do but not intentionally," explains Mansour. "We are trying to make it suitable for a Middle East audience." 
Even the terror group ISIS is fair game. "SNL in Arabic" is pointedly referring to them by the derogatory Arabic name, Daesh.
 "They get pissed off from [being called] Daesh, so we say Daesh," Mansour adds. "It's quite different if you know that enemy and know all the inside information that could give you the upper hand to make people laugh."

It took two years of planning to get the show on air. 
The Cairo version will follow the original "Saturday Night Live" satirical sketch comedy model, codified in the SNL bible for franchises around the world. 
Last May, several members traveled to New York to meet the original show's cast.
"They had 40 years of figuring it out and to write it in one format book," says Alfons. "It's just a matter of finding the right content for our audience and tweaking the jokes so they are relevant and funny to the entire Middle East."
There will be weekly celebrity hosts. The premiere's guest is one of the region's biggest movie stars, Egyptian actress Donia Samir Ghanem.
They'll also have the other "SNL" mainstays of sketches, digital shorts, the news with "Weekend Update," and live performances.
Three members of the New York cast -- Pete Davidson, Taran Killam and Aidy Bryant -- posted a video wishing their Egyptian colleagues well.
"Welcome to the 'SNL' family and good luck!" they say. "Bye! Later!"
"We done? Yeah, good luck. ... They are doomed," adds Killam.
"It's going to be tough, it's a tough job," says Bryant.
It is a tough job. "SNL in Arabic" puts on two shows a week with a quarter of the staff of the parent show. While they do a one-take performance in front of a live studio audience, the show isn't broadcast live for technical reasons. 
They hope that will change soon. 

"It is hell, (Davidson, Killam and Bryant) were right about that," says Yara Fahmy, one of the four female cast members. "It's an amazing kind of hell."
Fahmy worked a desk job before auditioning with hundreds of other Egyptians to make the final cut of 12 cast members.
She admits she didn't know about the original "Saturday Night Live" before her audition.
"I went online and looked it up then I started binge watching 'SNL.' I was totally in love," she says. "Kristen Wiig, she is amazing. Every character she does is different. She just appears and people start to laugh. So confident."
"SNL in Arabic" isn't the first satire show in the Middle East.
"'ElBernameg' set the tone for this kind of comedy. It was satire, political and social," says Mansour. "It kind of set a bar for everyone to try to meet. We are trying to live off that legacy." 
"ElBernameg" rose out Egypt's 2011 revolution.
Host Bassem Youssef, was dubbed the Middle East's Jon Stewart. Alfons and Mansour both worked on the groundbreaking program that boasted a weekly audience of tens of millions of people across the Middle East. 
But in July 2013, the military overthrew one of the main targets of Youssef's satire, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy. When Youssef applied the same sharp wit to the country's new rulers, the show was quickly taken off air. Bassem Youssef now lives in self-imposed exile.
WATCH: Bassem Youssef crashes CNN
The new comedy show will appear on OSN, a private, paid satellite service in the Middle East that is known for its lack of censorship.
"'SNL' will ruffle some feathers for sure, but we will always be respectful to our cultural identity. One can criticize without prejudice," says OSN's EVP of programming and creative services, Khulud Abu Homos. "It's a thin line sometimes, but we are determined to make sure a balance is set between edgy comedy and responsible comedy."
Mansour and Alfons also know the red lines firsthand.
"We can't really push so hard we repel people. We have to build a fan base and foundation first," explains Alfons. "We still push the envelope, and by some people's standards that's not cool. But we will crush them."
"No," Mansour interrupts. "That's a little bit ISIS-y, don't say that."

How Lee's masterpiece changed you
Gene Seymour is a film critic who has written about music, movies and culture for The New York Times, Newsday, Entertainment Weekly and the Washington Post. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.
 (CNN)Any day now, we're constantly told, books will no longer exist and humankind will depend exclusively on images and tweets to tell its stories. From the latter half of the 20th century all the way through the first 15 years of the 21st, there's been endless chatter predicting the end of printed pages between binders. Or, at least, of their power and influence on people.
And yet, it was through much of this same period of time that a single book telling a slight, yet tender story of childhood, terror and injustice in a small Southern town was asserting its influence upon several generations of readers. Many were so inspired by the moral example set by the book's lawyer-hero that they went to law school. 
Many more were guided by the book's gentle equanimity and humane wit counseling greater compassion toward others, regardless of how different they look -- or how strange they may seem.
The book, of course, was "To Kill a Mockingbird," whose reclusive author Harper Lee died this week at age 89. Published in 1960, Lee's (at least somewhat)  autobiographical novel, for the relative few who have neither read the book nor seen its equally-cherished 1962 movie adaptation, chronicles three fateful Depression-era years in the life of a 10-year-old tomboy named Scout Finch, growing up in a small Alabama town. 
Everything in the book revolves around a trial in which her kindly father Atticus defends a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. 
Lee, known best to friends, like her childhood pal Truman Capote, by her first name, "Nelle," began writing the book during the 1950s while working as an airline reservation clerk in New York City, which was quite a ways from her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, where her father, Amasa Coleman "A.C." Lee, practiced law. 
"To Kill a Mockingbird" was an overnight best-seller and a Pulitzer Prize winner for fiction. Its arrival coincided with the peak years of the civil rights movement in the South and its implicit plea for tolerance, along with the persistent urgency of America's racial dialogue, has kept it in print and in schools for decades afterward. 
Indeed, affection for the book is so abiding and strong that it has apparently withstood last year's controversial publication of Lee's only other novel, "Go Set a Watchman, "a longer, earlier draft of "Mockingbird" in which an older Atticus Finch is depicted as a far less racially tolerant man than he's shown in the earlier novel. 
Still, that affection is hardly universal. Some critics, even at the time it was first published, considered the book contrived and overly melodramatic.
Flannery O'Connor, whose far-more forbidding fiction about the South has exerted its own powerful influence over succeeding generations, famously said of "Mockingbird" in one of her letters: "I think it's interesting that all the folks who are buying it don't know they're reading a child's book."
 Whether you choose to take O'Connor's sardonic observation as a put-down depends on how seriously you take novels for children -- or, if you prefer, "young adults." And one should take such books as seriously (as opposed to solemnly) as any 15-year-old, or even as the precocious 11-year-old I used to be, enthralled by the 1962 "Mockingbird" movie before reading the book a couple years later. 
And I wasn't alone among my baby-boom generation of readers, if the testimony assembled in Mary Murphy's 2010 documentary, "Hey Boo: Harper Lee and To Kill a Mockingbird" is any measure of the book's impact. Most of the film's talking heads -- including Anna Quindlen, James McBride, Rosanne Cash, Tom Brokaw, Richard Russo, Diane McWhorter and the unavoidable Oprah Winfrey -- are more or less part of the first wave of readers affected by "Mockingbird," in print and on-screen. 
Within its celebratory context, Murphy's film deftly isolates the places in the novel that make our hearts bleed most indelibly. There is, for instance, the part where the black people consigned to the courtroom balcony throughout poor Tom Robinson's rape trial rise to their feet as Atticus stalks out alone in defeat. 
"Hey, Boo" depicts both print and film versions simultaneously as Winfrey's reading of the specific passage is juxtaposed against its cinematic counterpart with Gregory Peck, who won an Academy Award for playing Atticus. It's a shrewd moment in the documentary as it demonstrates to its viewers how much more resonant and vivid Lee's words are at evoking the emotional impact. 
But it's the documentary's title that keeps me emotionally connected to "Mockingbird." Those two words, "Hey, Boo," come at the moment in the movie when Scout (Mary Badham) coaxes the frightened neighborhood recluse Boo Radley (Robert Duvall) from the shadows. That moment, even more than the racial context of the story, conveys the essence of Lee's simple story: The open-hearted encounter of people we find odd or frightening. 
Human transactions are, of course, far more complicated than the relatively simple disclosures by "Mockingbird" can withstand -- which is why we read writers such as O'Connor or William Faulkner, whose 1948 novel, "Intruder in the Dust," bears a passing resemblance to Lee's. 
But there are worse fates for any novel than to become an enduring gateway for readers, young and old, toward accepting and, eventually, understanding what it means to walk in somebody else's shoes. 
The journeys all our hearts have made towards such enlightenment began with Nelle Harper Lee's memories. Those journeys haven't ended. Her memories live on. So will the book.

Outrage at rare dolphin's 'death by selfie'
 (CNN)A new video has surfaced showing the confusion surrounding the health of a rare La Plata dolphin being taken out of the water by beach-goers in Argentina earlier this month. The video shows some in the crowd saying the dolphin was dead while others called for it to be returned to the ocean. 
Vida Silvestre, a wildlife foundation in Argentina, reported that one dolphin died after a group of beach-goers took it out of the ocean, then surrounded and handled it. 
READ: Whales beached in UK
Sky News obtained video of a person removing a dolphin from the water in Santa Teresita, a coastal town about 350 kilometers southeast of Buenos Aires, and beachgoers took photos of a dolphin that appears to have been left to die in the sand. 
It is unclear why the dolphin was initially removed from the water, and the new video cuts off after the dolphin is laid on the sand and people are patting it. 
The Argentine wildlife organization released a statement urging people to return the dolphins to sea if they come across them.
"It is vital that people help to rescue these animals, because every Franciscan counts," they wrote.
The sea mammal, which typically shies away from humans, is found mostly in the waters of the Rio de La Plata and the Atlantic coast between Argentina and Uruguay, and has also been seen off the shores of Brazil.
The La Plata dolphin was placed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species after hundreds of them were caught annually in fishermen gillnets in the 1960s, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

La Plata dolphins -- also known as Franciscan dolphins because their brown-toned skin is reminiscent of the attire of Franciscan monks -- can live up to 20 years, according to NOAA.

How ISIS recruits, kills kids
 (CNN)Eleven-year-old Abu Imara al Omri kneels down to kiss his father's hand; a final blessing before the boy blows himself up in a truck full of explosives.
The disturbing goodbye was captured in a series of ISIS propaganda photos last month.
Supporters of the terror group claim the boy was used to help take the village of Ghazl near Aleppo, Syria.
But Omri is not alone. The use of child soldiers far predates ISIS, but what concerns researchers and policymakers is that ISIS' use of boys and girls does not follow the trends of previous conflicts.
ISIS does not use those under 18 because they provide specific technical advantage in combat or because they are short of fighters. Child soldiers are seemingly treated no differently than adult soldiers, according to a new study published Friday in the CTC Sentinel.
What this means in the self-proclaimed Islamic Caliphate is there simply is no sanctity accorded to childhood.
Mapping ISIS attacks around the world

Researchers say that sad fact could not only have implications on the battlefield, as the chance for military encounters between coalition-backed forces and ISIS child fighters increases. 
The findings also show that eliminating ISIS will be much more complicated than killing its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, or disarming his fighters. There's the question of what to do about potentially thousands of indoctrinated children left behind.
Opinion: How to beat ISIS propaganda 
The cases of Omri and the 88 other children eulogized by ISIS in the past 13 months are documented in the study, which includes an open source database of ISIS child propaganda, the first of its kind.
"What this database points to is the fact that use of children is far more normalized," Charlie Winter, the report's co-author, told CNN. "They are not just being used to shock people in execution videos. They are being used for their operational value as well. This is something that sadly we have to expect to increase and accelerate as the situation becomes more precarious for ISIS in the years to come."
Researchers from Georgia State University have been combing Twitter and ISIS channels on Telegram to record the children's ages, dates, nationalities -- anyone 18 or younger. The trends are striking and deeply troubling.
Child soldier who escaped ISIS: 'Like coming back to life'

Most of the children are from Syria. Most were killed in Iraq. Of the 89 cases, 39% died detonating a vehicle born IED device and 33% were killed as foot soldiers. Some 4% killed themselves while committing mass casualty attacks against civilians, and 6% died as propagandists embedded with brigades.
Researchers say they've noticed an emerging ISIS tactic. 
Nearly 20% of the children killed were inghimasis, or "marauders" who carried out so-called "plunging attacks." That's a military operation in which a group of fighters attack an enemy position before blowing themselves up.
Last month, five adult ISIS fighters flanked by three children infiltrated the Tariq base in Iraq. ISIS boasted that the group attacked from within for three hours, killing people before detonating their suicide belts. Winter says this shows the children are not being used to replace adults. They are integrated into ISIS' military operations -- often with parental consent.
"It's interesting the degree to which the parents are giving the organization access to their children," said Mia Bloom, the co-author of the report. "It's not a coercive endeavor like what we saw in Africa. The kids are not being kidnapped. The kids are not being coerced. For the most part, what we're seeing is kids posing with a big smile and at least in one case saying goodbye to the parents." 
Mass graves, missing children

ISIS has long made clear its intent to raise the next generation of jihadists, calling them the "cubs of the caliphate." In a recent publication of their English language magazine Dabiq, it encourages mothers to sacrifice their sons for the self-proclaimed Islamic state.
"As for you, O mother of lion cubs. ... And what will make you know what the mother of lion cubs is? She is the teacher of generations and the producer of men," the article reads. 
Winters says what is happening is very similar to how Saddam Hussein used child fighters in Iraq.
"Even right down to the cubs of the caliphate, there was the cubs of Saddam," he said. 
"ISIS is integrating children into its project in a way that is more reminiscent of a state than a non-state actor. It's thinking with the long term in mind. It's not just bringing children into its ranks and using them immediately on the battlefield. What it's doing is bringing them in, indoctrinating them, training them, spending a lot of time instilling them with jihadist ideology."
Bloom says the database of 89 children killed is a snapshot of a larger phenomenon. She estimates there are at least 1,500 ISIS child fighters, which poses unique challenges for the coalition on the battlefield and in terms of rehabilitation.
"The way you got the kids out of child soldiering in Liberia, Uganda or Mozambique was you use two things. You use the family and you use religion," Bloom says. 
"The problem with ISIS is that they've distorted the religion, and the families are colluding with ISIS to allow them access to the kids. So there's additional challenges, and we don't have a really good template to use ... it's a big problem."

'Go Set a Watchman': Bombshell of a book
Jay Parini, a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont.  His newest book is "Empire of Self:  A Life of Gore Vidal," which comes out in October. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.
 (CNN)After months of speculation, we have in our hands the second novel by Harper Lee, "Go Set a Watchman" -- published 55 years after "To Kill a Mockingbird" appeared to loud acclaim in 1960, with a major film adaptation in 1962. 
"Watchman" is, in fact, a bombshell of a book, as it presents Atticus Finch, the classic hero of "Mockingbird," as a racist old man of 72 who says to his horrified adult daughter:  "You realize that our Negro population is backward, don't you?"
He doesn't want them to get their voting rights, he explains, "because if the Negro vote edged out the white you'd have Negroes in every county office."
The new novel isn't a sequel, though it functions in that way.  It was written before "To Kill a Mockingbird," and the young author was asked by a shrewd editor to put the manuscript aside and return in her mind to the heroine's earlier days, which are barely mentioned. 
For instance, one gets only a few paragraphs in "Watchman" about the rape of a white girl and the black man, Tom Robinson, accused of the crime.  
As a young lawyer, Atticus -- the widowed father of two children, Scout and Jem -- takes Robinson's case because his conscience dictates that he do so.  His daughter later recalls: "Atticus took his career in his hands, made good use of a careless indictment, took his stand before a jury, and accomplished what was never before or afterwards done in Maycomb County:  he won an acquittal for a colored boy on a rape charge.  The chief witness for the prosecution was a white girl."
This tiny seed of narrative blossoms fully in "Mockingbird," especially in the film.  Yet it's fascinating to notice that in "Go Set a Watchman," Robinson actually gets off.  In "Mockingbird," he's found guilty. 
In "Watchman," Scout -- who goes mostly by her proper name, Jean Louise -- returns from New York City to visit her father, whom she once considered a paragon of virtue.  But she is shocked to see him transformed into a raving segregationist, an opponent of lawyers who want to fight for civil rights.
He tells his daughter:  "Scout, you probably don't know it, but the NAACP-paid lawyers are standing around like buzzards down here ..."  
His liberal daughter doesn't know what to say to her cranky and prejudiced father, who can't even listen to her now.
There is hardly any plot in "Go Set a Watchman," and very little tension.
It's just the story of a return visit to a place that the adult Scout wants to forget but can't. The prose is ordinary, even dull, and the narrative pace is slack:  a kind word might be "leisurely." 
It's obvious why Harper Lee's editor quietly asked her to shelve it, and it's perhaps embarrassing that it has come out.
On the other hand, it's difficult to imagine it will tarnish "To Kill a Mockingbird," which has sold over 40 million copies and found a solid place on the curriculum of most American schools.  Indeed, my youngest son once complained to me that he was forced to read this novel five times while in school.  Quite reasonably, he wondered: Is this novel really so wonderful?
The answer is yes and no.  
Ditching the third-person narrative of "Go Set a Watchman," Lee found the lyrical voice of Scout, who recounts with some gusto the story of her life with her father and brother and a friend called Dill, who sometimes visits his aunt in Maycomb.  (Dill is thought to have been modeled on Lee's childhood friend, the novelist Truman Capote.) 
The trial of Tom Robinson was only a part of "To Kill a Mockingbird," but it became central to the film, and Atticus (played by Gregory Peck) inspired generations of young men and women to enter the legal profession. 
Serious critics have found Lee's famous novel flawed.
Recently, for instance, Sarah Churchwell observed that Atticus is not as morally impeccable as people like to imagine: "Lee's hero is a virtuous, middle-class white man, full of noblesse oblige to the black people he defends (who revere him for it), but who doesn't bat an eyelid at the common knowledge that the illiterate, white-trash Mayella Ewell is regularly raped and beaten by her father."  
I myself have cringed at the honey-coated morality of Finch, who -- as his daughter says, "hated guns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who ever lived." 
Certainly in the context of a deeply racist town in the South in the 1930s, Finch seems remarkably bold in character, eager to teach his children how to step into the shoes of other people before passing judgments. 
Because of this, it's wrenching to discover that the elder Atticus, as portrayed in "Watchmen," has become a bigoted fool who wants to stop black people from voting.
Teachers of "To Kill a Mockingbird" across the nation will now have to explain to their students what happened to Atticus in later life and how his moral compass got so terribly out of whack.
They may find this a "teachable moment," noting that the long battle for civil rights even now remains at the forefront of American life.  There are still efforts afoot across the country to stifle black voices -- as in the guise of voter ID laws, which are supposed to suppress voter fraud but are really aimed at suppressing minority voices.
Indeed, it was only two years ago that the Supreme Court eviscerated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 -- a major piece of Civil Rights legislation. In North Carolina today, the issues of voting and discrimination -- as described in "Go Set a Watchman" -- seem as relevant as ever. 
Scout soulfully asks herself in "Watchman":  "What was this blight that had come down over the people she loved?"  
It's a pertinent question, and Lee's novel -- however minor as a work of literature -- seems timely in the wake of Ferguson, Baltimore, Charleston and so many other recent sites of racial tension.  
One can hope that the attention this novel will certainly receive will occasion sound discussions of a difficult past that has become our difficult present.

Near-hurricane winds rip Midwest
 (CNN)Near hurricane-force winds from Chicago's Lake Michigan on Friday shredded roofs, windows, trees and fences, and caused 160 canceled flights at O'Hare airport. 
In one picture tweeted by a resident, the roof dangled over the side of a brick apartment building.
"Pretty sure my roof is supposed to be more on the roof. #WindyCity," Michael Lansu tweeted, with a photo of torn roofing material and what appeared to be broken plywood.
A wind advisory was issued for much of the Midwest near the Great Lakes on Friday, and communities in the greater Chicago area saw gusts often reach more than 60 mph and even 72 mph in one spot, the National Weather Service said.
Meanwhile, gales whipped the open water off Chicago at 63.6 knots. A gale warning will last through Saturday with waves reaching 10 to 20 feet in parts of Lakes Michigan, Huron and Ontario through Saturday, the service said.
"A high volume of outage calls" overwhelmed ComEd, the electric utility said on Twitter. At least 114,000 people were without power at one point, with at least half of those blackouts in Chicago, CNN affiliate WLS reported.
O'Hare International Airport reported more than 160 flight cancellations and delays up to 50 minutes, the facility said on Twitter. 
Commuter train service in the city was also disrupted due to debris on tracks in some locations, the Chicago Transit Authority said. 
There were no immediate reports of injuries, despite the apparent damage.
Residents and motorists recounted the terrifying winds on social media, with photography of the damage.
Truck driver David Warren was knocked off the road, and his semitrailer landed on its side in the dirt beside Interstate 35 near Ellsworth, Iowa.
"I come into this clearing and the gust of wind just picked me up and brought me over and set me on my side, and I mean there was no stopping it once it started. It just picked me up and threw me right over like I was a piece of trash on the side of the road," Warren told CNN affiliate KCCI.
In another incident, a ferocious wind toppled a canopy that would normally protect motorists at the pump.
"Touhy and Elmhurst! Wind toppled over Marathon overhang!" Chicago area resident Joseph Bittolo tweeted
Buildings in downtown Chicago were evacuated apparently because flying debris from nearby construction sites broke windows, WLS reported.
The blustery weather was caused by strong southwest winds in association with a strong low pressure area to the north of Chicago.
CNN's Amanda Jackson and Artemis Moshtaghian contributed to this report.

Billions at stake in Apple encryption case
Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of the new book "United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists."
 (CNN)It's a dispute that pits two important principles against each other. It's about the right of the U.S. government to investigate thoroughly the most deadly terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11 versus the right of the most valuable (and iconic) American company to go about its business without the same U.S. government undercutting the key promise it makes consumers -- that their most private communications are kept safely under lock and key.
It's also a dispute that sets the stage for what promises to be one of the great commercial battles of the next years, between the U.S. government and the tech companies that are the most important engine of the booming American economy.
The FBI has argued for years that it faces a "going dark" problem, that its investigations of everything from child pornographers to terrorists are hampered, or even completely undercut, by the fact that so much Internet communication is now encrypted to a level that the U.S. government can't break.
As a result, the FBI wants a "backdoor" into the encrypted communications platforms engineered by American tech companies.
The tech companies reject this demand on the basis that such a backdoor defeats the whole purpose of encrypted communications since if a backdoor exists, not only can the FBI use it, but also so can others.
The companies argue -- quite properly -- that when you build a fence around your house to keep out intruders you don't leave a big hole in the fence for the easy access of police in the event that a crime might take place inside the house, because others can also exploit that big hole.
In addition, the firms argue that if it is known they have given the U.S. government such a backdoor, then consumers around the world will be leery of using Apple and Google and other U.S. technology products. Many tens of billions of dollars are therefore at stake.
The new occasion of this long-simmering dispute is Apple's rejection Wednesday of a federal judge's order to help the FBI hack into the encrypted iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook, who in December, together with his wife, killed 14 of his co-workers at a holiday party in San Bernardino, California.
The couple carried out the attack on behalf of ISIS, although there is no evidence they did so at the direction of the group.
On the face of it, Apple's rejection of the judge's order seems quite wrongheaded. After all, the San Bernardino attack was the most lethal since 9/11.
Apple's position, however, is that helping the FBI to decrypt Farook's iPhone would give the government access to all other similar iPhones and would also lead to an unfortunate precedent in which the government could eventually access encrypted communications on any American tech platform. Google has publicly supported Apple's position.
So who is right here? The revelations by National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden in 2013 about just how much U.S. tech companies had been playing footsie with the U.S. government had an effect on the firms' bottom lines around the globe.
 A 2014 paper by my colleagues at the New America think tank estimated that the Snowden revelations cost U.S. tech companies billions of dollars.
Since Snowden went public, companies such as Apple and Google -- two of the world's most valuable companies -- have incorporated much greater encryption into their products and have also been at pains to show that they will not go along with U.S. government demands to access their encrypted products.
What might be learned from Farook's iPhone? Of course, we don't know, but it's likely that it wouldn't be much beyond what we already know from the couple's Facebook postings, their Verizon phone account, their computers seized by police, the evidence found at their apartment complex and the fulsome confession of their friend Enrique Marquez, who allegedly provided them with the rifles used in their massacre and also allegedly knew of their plans to commit a terrorist attack as early as 2012.
No evidence has emerged that Farook and his wife had any formal connection to a terrorist organization, and the plot involved only the couple and the alleged connivance of Marquez. What might be found on Farook's iPhone therefore is more than likely simply only some additional details to buttress the overall account of what we know already.
Balanced against that is what the tech companies lose if they are seen to be doing the bidding of the FBI -- tens of billions of dollars and also the strong possibility of losing market share to other non-American tech companies, particularly software and cloud computing firms, around the world.
A further wrinkle in the story is provided by Daily Beast reporter (and my New America colleague) Shane Harris who reported that Apple has decrypted iPhones for U.S. law enforcement authorities 70 times in the past several years and as recently as 2015. At the same time, Harris reports the government has successfully decrypted at least one version of the iPhone.
These revelations suggest the possibility that the facts of this particular case aren't as important as the larger principles at stake and that both Apple and the U.S. government are using the San Bernardino case as something of a test of the question: Should tech companies give the FBI any kind of permanent backdoor?
The San Bernardino test case will likely set up a legal fight that could go to the Supreme Court. It also may prompt Congress to intervene to pass legislation on the matter.
Although the fight between American tech companies and the FBI hunting terrorists is undeniably important, to some degree it may also be increasingly moot.
ISIS' key social media-encrypted platform is Telegram, which is engineered by a Berlin-based tech company that can simply ignore the rulings of American federal judges as well as legislation passed by the U.S. Congress.
ISIS also advocates to its followers to use the "dark Web" Tor browser, which disguises users' IP addresses and is not controlled by any American tech company.
In other words, once again, technology is outrunning the ability of both law enforcement and legislation to keep pace with it.
